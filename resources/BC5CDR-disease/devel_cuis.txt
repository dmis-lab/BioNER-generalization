The -

therapeutically -
targeted -

with -
the -

In -

the -

was -
restored -
by -
5 -

in -
an -
animal -
study -
using -

These -
animal -
models -
were -
considered -
to -
reflect -
the -
positive -
symptoms -
of -
schizophrenia D012559
, -
and -
the -
above -
evidence -
suggests -
that -
altered -
5 -
- -
HT6 -
receptors -
are -
involved -
in -
the -
pathophysiology -
of -
psychotic D011605
disorders -
. -

The -
symptoms -
of -

- -
induced -
psychosis D011605
are -
similar -
to -
those -
of -
paranoid D012563

Therefore -
, -
we -
conducted -
an -
analysis -
of -
the -

in -
the -
Japanese -

The -
age -

of -
the -

did -
not -
differ -
from -
those -

RESULTS -
: -

In -
the -

we -
detected -
an -

we -
report -
that -

MEK1 -
was -
significantly -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Doxorubicin -

tubular -
injury -
was -
monitored -
and -
correlated -
to -
the -
activity -

Finally -
, -
we -
quantified -
both -
nuclear -

RESULTS -
: -
The -

Among -
all -

CASE -
SUMMARY -
: -
A -
46 -

American -
man -
experienced -

, -
then -
petit -

seizures D012640
as -
the -
infusion -
was -
stopped -
and -
the -
drug -
concentrations -
decreased -
with -
time -
. -

The -
patients -
concurrent -
medications -
included -
didanosine -
, -
hydroxyzine -
, -
promethazine -
, -
hydrocortisone -
, -
and -
prochlorperazine -
. -

Despite -
administration -
of -
phenytoin -
and -
lorazepam -
, -
the -
seizures D012640
persisted -
and -
occurred -
only -
during -
amphotercin -
B -
administration -
. -

DISCUSSION -
: -
AIDS D000163
and -
cryptococcal D016919
meningitis -
, -
both -
of -
which -
the -
patient -
had -
, -
can -
potentially -
cause -
seizures D012640
. -

The -
patient -
had -
a -
history -
of -
alcohol D000437
abuse -
; -
alcohol -
intake -
as -
well -
as -
withdrawal -
can -
also -
cause -
seizures D012640
. -

Didanosine -
also -
has -
a -
potential -
for -
inducing -
seizures D012640
. -

However -
, -
these -
other -
potential -
causes -
of -
seizure D012640
were -
ruled -
out -
. -

The -
time -
course -
of -
events -
suggested -
that -
amphotericin -
B -
was -
the -
cause -
of -
the -
seizures D012640
in -
this -
AIDS D000163
patient -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Amphotericin -
B -
seems -
to -
be -
the -
probable -
cause -
of -
the -
seizures D012640
. -

To -
date -
, -
only -
three -
cases -
of -
seizures D012640
associated -
with -
amphotericin -
B -
have -
been -
reported -

should -
be -
aware -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Pemoline -
is -
an -
oxazolidine -

is -
structurally -
different -
from -
amphetamines -
and -
used -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -

Pemoline -
has -
not -
been -
commonly -

in -
the -
literature -
as -
a -
cause -
of -
acute -
movement D009069

The -
following -
case -
describes -
two -
children -
acutely -
poisoned -

pemoline -
who -
experienced -

found -
playing -
with -
a -
an -
empty -
bottle -
of -
pemoline -
originally -
containing -

The -
children -
had -
a -
medical -
history -
significant -
for -

deficit -
disorder -
previously -
treated -
with -
methylphenidate -
without -
success -
. -

This -
was -
their -
first -
day -
of -
pemoline -
therapy -
. -

The -
choreoathetoid D002819|D001264
movements -
began -
45 -
min -
to -
1 -
h -
after -
ingestion -
. -

The -
children -
gave -
no -
history -
of -
prior -
movement D009069
disorders -
and -
there -
was -
no -
family -
history -
of -

. -

The -
children -
received -
gastrointestinal -
decontamination -
and -
high -
doses -
of -
intravenous -
benzodiazepines -
in -
an -
attempt -
to -
control -
the -
choreoathetoid D002819|D001264
movements -
. -

Despite -
treatment -
, -
the -
children -
continued -
to -
have -
choreoathetosis D002819|D001264
for -
approximately -
24 -
hours -
. -

Forty -
- -
eight -
hours -
after -
admission -
, -
the -
children -
appeared -
to -
be -
at -
their -
baseline -
and -
were -
discharged -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Pemoline -
associated -
movement D009069
disorder -
has -
been -
rarely -
reported -
in -
the -
acute -
toxicology -
literature -
. -

The -
possibility -
of -
choreoathetoid D002819|D001264
movements -
should -
be -
considered -
in -
patients -
presenting -
after -

cystitis -
. -

Hemorrhagic D006470|D003556
cystitis -
is -
a -
major -
potential -
toxicity D064420
of -
ifosfamide -
that -
can -
be -
prevented -
by -
administering -
mesna -
along -
with -
the -
cytotoxic -
agent -
. -

Mesna -
is -
generally -
administered -
by -
the -
intravenous -
route -
, -
although -
experience -
with -
oral -
delivery -
of -
the -
drug -
has -
increased -
. -

The -
continuous -
subcutaneous -
administration -
of -
mesna -
has -
the -
advantage -
of -
not -
requiring -
intravenous -
access -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
subcutaneous -
delivery -
of -
the -
neutralizing -
agent -
will -
not -
be -
associated -
with -
the -
risk -
of -
inadequate -
urinary -
mesna -
concentrations -
, -
such -
as -
in -
a -
patient -
taking -
oral -
mesna -
who -
experiences -
severe -
ifosfamide -
- -
induced -
emesis D014839
and -
is -
unable -
to -
absorb -
the -
drug -
. -

Limited -
clinical -
experience -
with -
continuous -
subcutaneous -
mesna -
administration -
suggests -
it -
is -
a -
safe -
, -
practical -
, -
and -
economic -
method -
of -
drug -
delivery -
that -
permits -
ifosfamide -
to -
be -
administered -
successfully -
in -
the -
outpatient -
setting -

muscular -

but -
NH4Ac -
treatment -
alone -
had -
no -

Thus -
, -
hyperammonemia D022124
is -
capable -
of -
altering -
drug -

and -
must -
be -
considered -
along -
with -

responses -
associated -
with -

Experiments -

showed -
that -
acetylcholine -

Addition -

reversed -
the -
depression D003866

but -
calcium -
- -
independent -
catecholamine -
release -
by -

was -
not -
blocked -
by -
NH4Ac -
. -

These -
results -
suggested -
that -
ammonia -
blocks -
calcium -
channels -
. -

Parallels -
in -
the -
actions -
of -
NH4Ac -
and -
the -
calcium -
channel -

this -
concept -

and -
neither -

The -
data -
suggest -
that -

exerts -
a -

The -
hemodynamic -
effects -
of -

may -
be -

The -

has -
been -
shown -
to -
block -

We -
report -
a -

manifested -
by -

this -
is -
the -

Characterization -

A -
patient -
with -
sinus -
bradycardia D001919
and -
atrioventricular D054537

, -
induced -
by -
carbamazepine -
, -
prompted -
an -
extensive -
literature -

all -
previously -

From -
the -
analysis -
of -
these -
cases -
, -
two -
distinct -
forms -
of -
carbamazepine -
- -
associated -
cardiac D006331
dysfunction -
emerged -
. -

One -
patient -
group -
developed -
sinus D013616
tachycardias -
in -
the -
setting -
of -
a -
massive -
carbamazepine -
overdose D062787

The -
second -
group -
consisted -
almost -
exclusively -
of -
elderly -

who -
developed -
potentially -
life -

bradyarrhythmias D001919

, -
associated -
with -
either -
therapeutic -
or -
modestly -
elevated -
carbamazepine -

Because -
carbamazepine -
is -
widely -
used -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
many -
neurologic -
and -
psychiatric D001523
conditions -
, -
the -
recognition -
of -

has -
important -
implications -
for -
the -

The -
inferior -
colliculus -
( -
IC -
) -
is -
primarily -
involved -
in -
the -
processing -
of -
auditory -
information -
, -
but -
it -
is -
distinguished -
from -
other -
auditory -
nuclei -
in -
the -
brainstem -
by -
its -
connections -
with -
structures -
of -
the -
motor -
system -
. -

Functional -
evidence -
relating -
the -
IC -
to -
motor -
behavior -
derives -
from -
experiments -
showing -
that -
activation -
of -
the -
IC -
by -
electrical -
stimulation -

microinjection -
causes -
freezing -

However -
, -
the -
nature -
of -
this -
immobility -
is -
still -
unclear -

The -
present -
study -
examined -
the -
influence -
of -

mechanisms -
in -
the -

Accordingly -
, -
intracollicular -
microinjection -
of -

increased -
the -

hiccups D006606

Hiccups D006606

. -

Discontinuation -
of -
azithromycin -

hiccups D006606
. -

No -
organic -
cause -
of -
hiccups D006606
was -

despite -
extensive -
investigation -
. -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Pharmacotherapeutic -
agents -
have -
been -
uncommonly -
associated -
with -
hiccups D006606
. -

Corticosteroids -
( -
dexamethasone -
and -
methylprednisolone -
) -
, -
benzodiazepines -
( -
midazolam -
) -
and -
general -
anaesthesia -
have -
been -
the -
specific -
agents -
mentioned -
most -
frequently -
in -
the -
literature -
as -
being -
associated -
with -
the -
development -
of -
hiccups D006606
. -

Few -
cases -
of -
drug -
- -
induced -
hiccups D006606
have -
been -
reported -
related -
to -
macrolide -
antimicrobials -

Using -

scale -
this -
event -
could -
be -
classified -
as -
possible -
( -
score -
5 -
points -
) -
, -
mostly -
because -
of -
the -
close -
temporal -
sequence -
, -
previous -
reports -
on -
this -
reaction -
with -
other -
macrolides -
and -
the -
absence -
of -
any -
alternative -
explanation -
for -
hiccups D006606
. -

Our -
hypothesis -
is -
that -
a -
vagal -
mechanism -
mediated -
by -
azithromycin -
could -
be -
the -
pathogenesis -
of -
hiccups D006606
in -
our -
patient -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Diagnosis -
of -
drug -
- -
induced -
hiccups D006606
is -
difficult -
and -
often -
achieved -
only -
by -
a -
process -
of -
elimination -
. -

However -
, -
macrolide -
antimicrobials -
have -
been -
reported -
to -
be -
associated -
with -
hiccups D006606

In -

The -

Headache D006261
was -

In -
the -

in -
migraineurs D008881
peak -
headache D006261

occurred -
at -
a -
mean -
time -

At -
this -
time -
the -
induced -
headache D006261
in -
6 -

of -
the -
International -
Headache D006261

The -
results -

suggest -
that -
NO -
is -
involved -
in -
the -
pain D010146
mechanisms -
of -

Italian -
Tamoxifen -
Prevention -
Study -
. -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Tamoxifen -
is -
a -
candidate -
chemopreventive -
agent -
in -
breast D001943
cancer -
, -
although -
the -
drug -
may -
be -
associated -
with -
the -
development -
of -
endometrial D016889
cancer -
. -

Therefore -
we -
did -
a -
trial -
in -
hysterectomised -
women -
of -
tamoxifen -
as -
a -
chemopreventive -
. -

METHODS -
: -
In -
October -
, -
1992 -
, -
we -
started -
a -
double -
- -
blind -
placebo -
- -
controlled -
, -
randomised -
trial -
of -
tamoxifen -
in -
women -
( -
mainly -
in -
Italy -
) -
who -
did -
not -
have -
breast D001943
cancer -
and -
who -
had -
had -
a -
hysterectomy -
. -

Women -
were -
randomised -
to -
receive -
tamoxifen -
20 -
mg -
per -
day -
or -
placebo -
, -
both -
orally -
for -
5 -
years -
. -

The -
original -
plan -
was -
to -
follow -
the -
intervention -

In -
June -
, -
1997 -
, -
the -
trialists -
and -
the -
data -
- -
monitoring -
committee -
decided -
to -
end -
recruitment -
primarily -
because -
of -
the -
number -
of -
women -
dropping -
out -
of -
the -
study -
. -

Recruitment -
ended -
on -
July -
11 -
, -
1997 -
, -
and -
the -
study -
will -
continue -
as -
planned -
. -

The -
primary -
endpoints -
are -
the -
occurrence -
of -
and -
deaths -
from -

This -
preliminary -

analysis -
is -

There -
is -
a -
statistically -
significant -

among -
women -
receiving -
tamoxifen -
who -
also -

the -
trial -
: -
among -
390 -
women -
on -
such -
therapy -
and -
allocated -

, -
we -
found -
eight -
cases -

breast D001943
cancer -
compared -
with -
one -
case -
among -
362 -
women -
allocated -
to -
tamoxifen -

Compared -
with -
the -
placebo -
group -

Comparison -

The -
H2 -

histamine -
receptor -
antagonists -
ranitidine -
and -
cimetidine -
were -
compared -
for -
their -
abilities -
to -
control -
gastric -
acid -
hypersecretion -
on -
a -
short -
- -
and -
long -
- -
term -
basis -
in -
22 -
patients -
with -
gastric -
acid -
hypersecretory -
states -
. -

Nineteen -
patients -
had -
Zollinger D015043
- -
Ellison -

, -
one -
patient -
had -
systemic D034721
mastocytosis -
, -
and -
two -
patients -
had -
idiopathic -
hypersecretion -
. -

The -
rates -
of -
onset -
of -
the -
action -
of -
cimetidine -
and -
ranitidine -
were -
the -
same -
. -

The -
actions -
of -
both -
drugs -
were -
increased -
by -
anticholinergic -
agents -
, -
and -
there -
was -
a -
close -
correlation -
between -
the -
daily -
maintenance -
dose -
of -
each -
drug -
needed -
to -
control -
acid -
secretion -
. -

However -
, -
ranitidine -
was -
threefold -
more -
potent -
than -
cimetidine -
both -
in -
acute -
inhibition -
studies -
and -
in -
the -
median -
maintenance -
dose -
needed -
( -
1 -

2 -
g -
per -
day -
for -
ranitidine -
and -
3 -
. -
6 -
g -
per -
day -
for -
cimetidine -
) -
. -

Sixty -
percent -
of -
the -
males -
developed -
breast -
changes -
or -
impotence D007172
while -
taking -
cimetidine -
and -
in -
all -
cases -
these -
changes -
disappeared -
when -
cimetidine -
was -
replaced -
by -
ranitidine -
. -

Treatment -
with -
high -
doses -
of -
cimetidine -
( -
one -
to -
60 -
months -
; -
median -
, -
11 -
months -
) -
or -
ranitidine -
( -
two -
to -
31 -
months -
; -
median -
, -
14 -
months -
) -
was -
not -
associated -
with -
hepatic D056486|D006402
or -
hematologic -
toxicity -
or -
alterations -
of -
serum -
gastrin -
concentrations -
, -
but -
ranitidine -
therapy -
was -
associated -
with -
a -
significantly -
lower -
serum -
creatinine -
level -
than -
seen -
with -
cimetidine -
therapy -
. -

The -
results -
show -
that -
both -
drugs -
can -
adequately -
inhibit -
acid -
secretion -
in -
patients -
with -
gastric -
hypersecretory -
states -
. -

Both -
are -
safe -
at -
high -
doses -
, -
but -
ranitidine -
is -
threefold -
more -
potent -
and -
does -
not -
cause -
the -
antiandrogen -
side -
effects -
frequently -
seen -
with -
high -
doses -
of -
cimetidine -

cells -
collected -
from -
the -
patient -
were -
cultured -
in -
the -

was -
observed -
either -
in -
the -
patient -
or -
in -
the -
healthy -

the -
patient -
compared -
with -
the -
proliferative -
response -
to -
the -
serum -
collected -
before -
the -

case -
report -
. -

Tacrolimus -
is -
a -
potent -
immunosuppressant -
that -
is -
frequently -
used -
in -
organ -
transplantation -
. -

However -
, -
adverse -
effects -
include -
cardiac D066126
toxicity -
. -

Herein -
we -
describe -
transient -
myocardial D006332
hypertrophy -
induced -
by -
tacrolimus -
after -
heart -
transplantation -
. -

The -
hypertrophy D006984
caused -
no -
clinical -
symptoms -
but -
was -
noted -
because -
of -
elevation -
of -
plasma -
brain -
natriuretic -
peptide -
concentration -
and -
confirmed -
at -
echocardiography -
. -

Initially -
, -
allograft -
rejection -
was -
feared -
; -
however -
, -
myocardial -
biopsy -
samples -
revealed -
only -
interstitial -
edema D004487
and -
mild -
myocardial D006332
hypertrophy -
; -
neither -
cellular -
nor -
humoral -
rejection -
was -
detected -
. -

The -
blood -
tacrolimus -
concentration -
was -
higher -
than -
usual -
at -
that -
time -
; -
thus -
, -
tacrolimus -
dosage -
was -
reduced -
. -

Myocardial D006332
hypertrophy -
completely -
resolved -
upon -
reducing -
the -
target -
concentration -
of -
tacrolimus -
and -
did -
not -
recur -
, -
as -
confirmed -
at -
echocardiography -
and -
myocardial -
biopsy -
. -

Thus -
, -
we -
conclude -
that -
tacrolimus -
induces -
reversible -
myocardial D006332
hypertrophy -
. -

In -
patients -
receiving -
tacrolimus -
therapy -
, -
blood -
concentration -
should -
be -
carefully -
controlled -
and -
extreme -
attention -
paid -
to -
cardiac -
involvement -

The -
development -

Whereas -

seems -
to -
be -
crucial -
for -
the -

Effects -
of -
suprofen -
on -
the -
isolated -
perfused -
rat -
kidney -
. -

Although -
suprofen -
has -
been -
associated -
with -
the -
development -
of -
acute D058186
renal -
failure -
in -
greater -
than -
100 -
subjects -
, -
the -
mechanism -
of -
damage -
remains -
unclear -
. -

The -
direct -
nephrotoxic D007674
effects -
of -
a -
single -
dose -
of -
15 -
mg -
of -
suprofen -
were -
compared -
in -
the -
recirculating -
isolated -
rat -
kidney -
perfused -
with -
cell -

free -
buffer -
with -
or -
without -
the -
addition -
of -
5 -
mg -

dL -
of -
uric -
acid -
. -

There -
were -
no -
significant -
differences -
in -
renal -
sodium -
excretion -
, -
oxygen -
consumption -
, -
or -
urinary -
flow -
rates -
in -
kidneys -
perfused -
with -
suprofen -
compared -
with -
the -
drug -
- -
free -
control -
groups -
. -

In -
contrast -
, -
a -
significant -
decline -
in -
glomerular -
filtration -
rate -
was -
found -
after -
the -
introduction -
of -
suprofen -
to -
the -
kidney -
perfused -
with -
uric -
acid -
; -
no -
changes -
were -
found -
with -
suprofen -
in -
the -
absence -
of -
uric -
acid -
. -

A -
significant -
decrease -
in -
the -
baseline -
excretion -
rate -
of -
uric -
acid -
was -
found -
in -
rats -
given -
suprofen -
, -
compared -
with -
drug -
- -
free -
controls -
. -

However -
, -
the -
fractional -
excretion -
of -
uric -
acid -
was -
unchanged -
between -
the -
groups -
over -
the -
experimental -
period -

, -
suprofen -

A -
variety -

abnormal -
sensory -

behaviors -
associated -
with -
electrical -
discharges -
recorded -
from -
the -
bilateral -

by -

and -
by -
acute -
and -
chronic -
administration -
of -

The -
electrode -
implant -
implicated -
one -
side -
or -
the -
other -
of -
the -
reticular -
system -
of -
the -
brainstem -
but -
subjects -
were -
not -
incapacitated -
by -
the -
stimulations -

Cocaine -
( -

was -
injected -
subcutaneously -
for -
an -
acute -

subsequent -
20 -
mg -

kg -
doses -
twice -
daily -
for -
3 -
days -
in -
a -
chronic -
study -

Cocaine -
generated -
more -
abnormal -
behaviors -
in -
the -
brainstem -

, -
especially -
the -
electrically -
perturbated -
subjects -
. -

The -
abnormal -
behaviors -
were -

Shifts -

were -
noted -
between -

Hypersensitivity D004342
to -
various -
auditory -
, -
tactile -
, -
and -
visual -
stimulation -
was -
present -
and -
shifts -
in -
the -
brainstem -
ambient -
power -
spectral -
frequency -
occurred -
in -
response -
to -
tactile -
stimulation -
. -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -
the -
brainstem -
generates -
and -
propagates -
pathological -
discharges -
that -
can -
be -
elicited -
by -
mechanical -
and -
DC -
electrical -
perturbation -
. -

Cocaine -
was -
found -
to -
activate -
the -
discharge -
system -
and -
thus -
induce -
abnormal -
behaviors -
that -
are -
generated -
at -
the -
discharge -
site -
and -
at -
distant -
sites -
to -
which -
the -
discharge -
propagates -
. -

Cognitive -
functions -
may -
also -
be -
involved -
since -
dopaminergic -
and -
serotonergic -
cellular -
elements -
at -
the -
brainstem -
level -
are -
also -
implicated -

Control -

Ethinyl -
estradiol -
treatment -
did -
not -
impair -
conjugation -
of -
deoxycholic -
acid -
, -
but -
did -
result -
in -
an -
increase -
in -
sulfation -

These -
results -
are -
consistent -
with -
the -
hypothesis -
that -
the -
rat -
has -
a -
poorer -
tolerance -
for -
deoxycholic -
acid -
than -
do -
certain -
other -
species -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
the -
rat -
converts -
deoxycholic -
acid -
, -
a -
poor -
choleretic -
, -
to -
taurocholic -
acid -
, -
a -
good -
choleretic -
. -

When -
this -
conversion -
is -
impaired -
with -
ethinyl -
estradiol -
treatment -
, -
sulfation -
may -
be -
an -
important -
alternate -
pathway -
for -
excretion -
of -
this -
potentially -
harmful -
bile -
acid -

we -

therefore -
, -
of -

magnitude -
to -
prevent -
a -

suggest -
that -

in -

However -
, -
when -

intravesically -
, -
PGE2 -
may -
stimulate -

by -
releasing -
tachykinins -
from -

CASE -
: -
A -
49 -
- -

, -
but -
recurred -
a -
year -
later -

The -
patient -
noticed -
that -
before -
these -
episodes -
he -
had -
been -
using -
an -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Swallowing -
- -
induced -
atrial D013617
tachyarrhythmia -
( -
SIAT D013617

is -
a -
rare -
phenomenon -

Fewer -
than -
50 -
cases -

SIAT D013617
have -
been -
described -
in -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Salbutamol -
is -
presented -
here -
as -
a -
possible -
trigger -
for -
SIAT D013617
. -

Although -
it -
is -
difficult -
to -
define -
causality -
in -
a -
case -
report -
, -
it -
is -
logical -
to -
think -
that -
a -
beta -
- -
agonist -
like -
salbutamol -
( -
known -
to -
induce -
tachycardia D013610
) -
may -
be -
the -
trigger -
of -
adrenergic -
reflexes -
originating -
in -
the -
esophagus -
while -
swallowing -
and -
that -
a -
beta -
- -
blocker -
such -
as -
atenolol -
( -
that -
blocks -
the -
adrenergic -
activity -
) -
may -
relieve -
it -

Also -
, -
histopathological -
renal D007674
tissue -
damage -
mediated -
by -
cisplatin -
was -
ameliorated -
by -

Here -
we -

assessed -
3 -
and -
6 -

administration -
. -

Metformin -
treatment -
fully -
blocked -
gentamicin -
- -
mediated -

This -
was -
accompanied -
by -
a -
lower -
activity -

, -
together -
with -
a -
decrease -
of -

. -

Metformin -
also -
protected -
the -
kidney -
from -
histological -
damage -
6 -
days -
after -
gentamicin -
administration -
. -

These -
in -
vivo -
markers -
of -
kidney D007674
dysfunction -
and -
their -
correction -
by -
metformin -
were -
complemented -
by -
in -

studies -
of -
mitochondrial -
function -
. -

We -
found -
that -
gentamicin -
treatment -
depleted -
respiratory -
components -
( -
cytochrome -
c -
, -
NADH -
) -
, -
probably -
due -
to -
the -
opening -
of -
mitochondrial -

pores -
. -

These -
injuries -
, -
partly -
mediated -
by -
a -
rise -
in -
reactive -
oxygen -
species -
from -
the -
electron -
transfer -
chain -
, -
were -
significantly -
decreased -
by -
metformin -
. -

Thus -
, -
our -
study -
suggests -
that -
pleiotropic -
effects -
of -
metformin -
can -
lessen -
gentamicin -
nephrotoxicity D007674
and -
improve -

INTRODUCTION -
: -
The -
possible -
anxiogenic -
effects -
of -
fluoroquinolones -
, -
namely -
ciprofloxacin -
and -
norfloxacin -
, -
were -
investigated -
in -
adult -

albino -
rats -
of -
either -
sex -
, -
weighing -
150 -
- -
200 -
g -
. -

METHODS -
: -
The -
drugs -
were -
given -
orally -
, -
in -
doses -
of -
50 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
for -
five -
consecutive -
days -
and -
the -
experiments -
were -
performed -
on -
the -
fifth -

. -

The -
tests -
included -
open -

, -
social -
interaction -
and -

behaviour -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
The -
results -
indicate -
that -
ciprofloxacin -
- -
and -
norfloxacin -
- -
treated -
rats -
showed -
anxious D001008
behaviour -
in -
comparison -
to -
control -
rats -
in -
all -
the -
parameters -
studied -
. -

However -
, -
ciprofloxacin -
- -
and -
norfloxacin -
- -
treated -
rats -
did -
not -
differ -
significantly -
from -
each -
other -
in -
various -
behavioural -
parameters -
. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
The -
present -
experimental -
findings -
substantiate -
the -
clinically -
observed -
anxiogenic -
potential -
of -
ciprofloxacin -
and -
norfloxacin -

, -
relatively -
few -
methods -
have -
been -
available -

In -
this -

, -
we -
developed -
a -

We -
then -
applied -

to -
the -

With -
this -

we -
were -

was -
to -
analyse -

Arteritis D001167
induced -
in -

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
the -
peak -
expression -
of -
iNOS -

was -
followed -
by -
that -

Topiramate -
- -
induced -
nephrolithiasis D053040
. -

Topiramate -
is -
a -
recently -
developed -
antiepileptic -
medication -
that -
is -
becoming -
more -
widely -
prescribed -
because -
of -
its -
efficacy -
in -
treating -
refractory D004827
seizures -
. -

Urologists -
should -
be -
aware -
that -
this -
medication -
can -
cause -
metabolic D000138
acidosis -
in -
patients -
secondary -
to -
inhibition -
of -
carbonic -
anhydrase -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
a -
distal -
tubular -
acidification -
defect -
may -
result -
, -
thus -
impairing -
the -
normal -
compensatory -
drop -
in -
urine -
pH -
. -

These -
factors -
can -
lead -
to -
the -
development -
of -
calcium -
phosphate -
nephrolithiasis D053040
. -

We -
report -
the -
first -
two -
cases -

OBJECTIVE -
: -
Nephrotoxicity D007674
is -
the -
major -

Selective -
distal -

toxicity D064420
seems -
to -
be -
responsible -
for -
the -
profound -
potassium -
wasting -
that -
is -
a -
major -
clinical -
side -
effect -
of -
treatment -
with -
AmB -
. -

Potassium -
depletion -
also -
potentiates -
the -
tubular -
toxicity D064420
of -
AmB -
. -

This -
study -
was -
designed -
to -
assess -
the -
ability -
of -
spironolactone -
to -
reduce -
potassium -
requirements -
and -
to -
prevent -
hypokalemia D007008
in -
neutropenic D009503
patients -
on -
AmB -
treatment -
. -

METHODS -
: -
In -
this -
study -
26 -
patients -
with -
various -
hematological D006402
disorders -
were -
randomized -
to -
receive -
either -
intravenous -
AmB -
alone -
or -
AmB -
and -
oral -
spironolactone -
100 -
mg -
twice -
daily -
when -
developing -
a -
proven -
or -
suspected -
fungal D009181
infection -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Patients -
receiving -
concomitant -
AmB -
and -
spironolactone -
had -
significantly -
higher -
plasma -
potassium -
levels -
than -
those -
receiving -
AmB -
alone -
( -
P -
= -
0 -
. -

) -
. -

Those -
patients -
receiving -
AmB -
and -
spironolactone -
required -
significantly -
less -
potassium -
supplementation -
to -
maintain -
their -
plasma -
potassium -
within -
the -
normal -
range -
( -
P -
= -

) -
. -

Moreover -
, -
urinary -
potassium -
losses -
were -
significantly -
less -
in -
patients -
receiving -

CONCLUSION -
: -
This -
study -
showed -
that -
spironolactone -
can -
reduce -
potassium -
requirements -
and -
prevent -
hypokalemia D007008
by -
reducing -

Excitotoxicity -1
leading -
to -
neuronal -
cell -
death -
in -
the -
affected -
areas -
is -
a -
major -
consequence -
of -
seizures D012640
at -
the -
cellular -
level -
. -

In -
this -
respect -
, -
little -
is -
known -
about -
the -
role -
of -
DA -
receptors -
in -
the -
occurrence -
of -
epilepsy D004827
- -
induced -
neuronal -
cell -
death -
. -

Here -
we -
analyze -
the -
occurrence -
of -
seizures D012640
and -
neurotoxicity D020258
in -
D2R -
- -
/ -
- -
mice -
treated -
with -
the -
cholinergic -
agonist -
pilocarpine -
. -

We -
compared -
these -
results -
with -
those -
previously -
obtained -
with -
kainic -
acid -
( -
KA -
) -
, -
a -
potent -
glutamate -
agonist -
. -

Importantly -
, -
D2R -
- -
/ -
- -
mice -
develop -
seizures D012640
at -
doses -
of -
both -
drugs -
that -
are -
not -
epileptogenic -
for -
WT -
littermates -
and -
show -
greater -
neurotoxicity D020258
. -

However -
, -
pilocarpine -
- -
induced -
seizures D012640
result -
in -
a -
more -
widespread -
neuronal -
death -
in -
both -
WT -
and -
D2R -
- -
/ -
- -
brains -
in -
comparison -
to -
KA -
. -

Thus -
, -
the -
absence -
of -
D2R -
lowers -
the -
threshold -
for -
seizures D012640
induced -
by -
both -
glutamate -
and -
acetylcholine -
. -

Moreover -
, -
the -
dopaminergic -
control -
of -
epilepsy D004827
- -
induced -
neurodegeneration D019636
seems -
to -
be -
mediated -
by -
distinct -
interactions -
of -
D2R -
signaling -
with -
these -
two -
neurotransmitters -

Chronically -

METHODS -
: -
The -
central -

Most -
electrophysiological -

However -
, -
five -
patients -
showed -
delayed -
30 -

Hz -
flicker -
b -
waves -
, -
and -
seven -
patients -
showed -
delayed -
oscillatory -
potentials -
. -

Multifocal -
ERG -
showed -
abnormalities -
that -
sometimes -
correlated -
with -
the -
visual -
field -
appearance -
and -
confirmed -
that -
the -
deficit -
occurs -
at -
the -
retinal -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Marked -
visual D014786
field -
constriction -
appears -
to -
be -
associated -
with -
vigabatrin -
therapy -

He -
remained -

Lithium -

is -

Ammonia -

This -

Thus -

the -

ammonia -
and -
the -
prevention -
of -
ammonia -
coma D003128
after -

can -
be -
accounted -
for -
by -
the -

alterations -
of -
plasma -
lipoproteins -
found -

, -
or -
, -
at -

The -
purpose -
of -
the -
present -
study -
was -
to -
investigate -
the -
changes -
in -
plasma -
and -
urinary -
lipoproteins -
during -
the -
administration -
of -
puromycin -
aminonucleoside -
( -
20 -

for -
7 -
days -
) -
and -
the -
subsequent -
development -
of -
nephrotic D009404
syndrome -
. -

Since -
massive -
albuminuria D000419
occurred -
after -
6 -
days -
of -
treatment -
, -
the -
time -
- -
course -
study -
was -
divided -
into -
two -
stages -
: -
pre -
- -
nephrotic D009404
stage -
( -
day -
1 -
- -
5 -
) -
and -
nephrotic D009404
stage -
( -
day -
6 -
- -
11 -
) -
. -

In -
pre -
- -
nephrotic D009404
stage -
the -
plasma -
level -
of -
fatty -
acids -
, -
triacylglycerol -
and -
VLDL -
decreased -
while -
that -
of -
phospholipid -
, -
cholesteryl -
esters -
and -
HDL -
remained -
constant -
. -

Plasma -
apolipoprotein -
A -
- -
I -
tended -
to -
increase -
( -
40 -
% -
increase -
at -
day -
5 -
) -
. -

At -
the -
beginning -
of -
nephrotic D009404
stage -
( -
day -
6 -
) -
the -
concentration -
of -
plasma -
albumin -
dropped -
to -
a -
very -
low -
level -
, -
while -
that -
of -
apolipoprotein -
A -
- -
I -
increased -
abruptly -
( -
4 -
- -
fold -
increase -
) -
and -
continued -
to -
rise -
, -
although -
less -
steeply -
, -
in -
the -
following -
days -
. -

The -
plasma -
concentration -
of -
HDL -
followed -
the -
same -
pattern -
. -

Plasma -
VLDL -
and -
LDL -
increased -
at -
a -
later -
stage -
( -
day -
9 -
) -
. -

Plasma -
apolipoprotein -
A -
- -
I -
was -
found -
not -
only -
in -
HDL -
( -
1 -
. -
063 -
- -
1 -
. -
210 -
g -
/ -
ml -
) -
but -
also -
in -
the -
LDL -
density -
class -
( -
1 -
. -
025 -
- -
1 -
. -
050 -
g -
/ -
ml -
) -
. -

In -
the -
pre -
- -
nephrotic D009404
stage -
lipoproteinuria -
was -
negligible -
, -
while -
in -
the -
early -
nephrotic D009404
stage -
the -
urinary -
loss -
of -
plasma -
lipoproteins -
consisted -
mainly -
of -
HDL -
. -

These -
observations -
indicate -
that -
puromycin -
aminonucleoside -
alters -
plasma -
lipoproteins -
by -
lowering -
VLDL -
and -
increasing -
HDL -
. -

It -
is -
likely -
that -
the -
early -
and -
striking -
increase -
of -
plasma -
HDL -
found -
in -
nephrotic D009404
rats -
is -
related -
to -
a -
direct -
effect -
of -
the -
drug -
on -
HDL -
metabolism -

acid -
and -
neutral -

, -
and -
acid -

were -
measured -
in -
the -
serum -
of -
patients -
with -
fulminant D017114
hepatic -

. -

Acid -
protease -
( -
cathepsin -
D -
) -
activity -
was -
increased -
about -
tenfold -
in -
patients -
who -
died -
and -
nearly -
fourfold -
in -
those -
who -
survived -
fulminant D017114
hepatic -
failure -
after -
paracetamol -

, -
whereas -
activities -
were -
increased -
equally -
in -
patients -
with -
fulminant D017114
hepatic -
failure -
due -
to -
viral D006525
hepatitis -
whether -
or -
not -
they -
survived -
. -

A -
correlation -
was -
found -
between -
serum -
acid -
protease -
activity -
and -
prothrombin -
time -
, -
and -
the -
increase -
in -
cathepsin -
D -
activity -
was -
sustained -
over -
several -
days -
compared -
with -
aspartate -
aminotransferase -
, -
which -
showed -
a -
sharp -
early -
peak -
and -
then -
a -
fall -
. -

Circulating -
lysosomal -
proteases -
can -
damage -
other -
organs -
, -
and -
measurement -
of -
their -
activity -
may -
therefore -
be -
of -
added -
value -
in -
assessing -

We -
found -
that -

of -
the -
diabetic D003920
kindreds -

The -
role -
of -
epinephrine -
in -
eliciting -
myocardial D017202
ischemia -
was -
examined -
in -
patients -
with -
coronary D003324
artery -
disease -
. -

Objective -
signs -
of -
ischemia D007511
and -
factors -
increasing -
myocardial -
oxygen -
consumption -
were -
compared -
during -
epinephrine -
infusion -
and -
supine -
bicycle -
exercise -
. -

Both -
epinephrine -
and -
exercise -
produced -
myocardial D017202
ischemia -
as -
evidenced -
by -
ST -
segment -
depression D003866
and -
angina D000787
. -

However -
, -
the -
mechanisms -
of -
myocardial D017202
ischemia -
induced -
by -
epinephrine -
were -
significantly -
different -
from -
those -
of -
exercise -
. -

Exercise -
- -
induced -
myocardial D017202
ischemia -
was -
marked -
predominantly -
by -
increased -
heart -
rate -
and -
rate -
- -
pressure -
product -
with -
a -
minor -
contribution -
of -
end -
- -
diastolic -
volume -
, -
while -
epinephrine -
- -
induced -
ischemia D007511
was -
characterized -
by -
a -
marked -
increase -
in -
contractility -
and -
a -
less -
pronounced -
increase -
in -
heart -
rate -
and -

pressure -
product -
. -

These -
findings -
indicate -
that -
ischemia D007511
produced -
by -
epinephrine -
, -
as -
may -
occur -
during -
states -
of -
emotional -
distress -
, -
has -
a -
mechanism -
distinct -
from -
that -
due -

, -
a -
transient -
period -
of -
contralateral D009069
rotation -
has -
been -
reported -
to -
precede -
the -
predominant -
ipsilateral D009069
circling -
. -

In -
order -
to -
clarify -
the -
nature -
of -
this -
initial -
contralateral D009069
rotation -
we -
examined -
the -
effect -
of -
the -
duration -
of -
recovery -
period -
after -
the -
lesion -
, -
on -
amphetamine -
- -
induced -
rotational D009069
behavior -
. -

Three -
days -
post -
lesion -
, -
most -
rats -
circled -
predominantly -
contralaterally -
to -
the -
lesion -
. -

Such -
contralateral D009069
rotation -
may -
result -
from -
either -
degeneration -
- -
induced -
breakdown -
of -
the -
DA -
pool -
, -
or -
lesion -
- -
induced -
increase -
of -
DA -
turnover -
in -
the -
spared -
neurons -
. -

A -
substantial -
degree -
of -
contralateral -
preference -
was -
still -
evident -
when -
amphetamine -
was -
administered -
for -
the -
first -
time -
24 -
days -
after -
lesioning -
, -
indicating -
involvement -
of -
spared -
cells -
in -
the -
contralateral D009069
rotation -
. -

However -
, -
regardless -
of -
the -
duration -
of -
recovery -
( -
and -
irrespective -
of -
either -
lesion -
volume -
, -
amphetamine -
dose -
, -
or -
post -
- -
lesion -
motor -
exercise -
) -
, -
amphetamine -
- -
induced -
rotation D009069
tended -
to -
become -
gradually -
more -
ipsilateral -
as -
the -
observation -
session -
progressed -
, -
and -
all -
rats -
circled -
ipsilaterally -
to -
the -
lesion -
in -
response -
to -
further -
amphetamine -
injections -
. -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -
amphetamine -
has -
an -
irreversible -
effect -
on -
the -
post -

DA -
pool -
contributing -
to -

The -

were -
smaller -

they -
were -
larger -

The -

We -
conclude -
that -

intermediate -
between -
that -

These -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
These -

, -
it -
may -
be -
of -
use -
in -
the -
management -
of -

because -
it -
does -
not -
induce -

Calcium -

It -
is -

that -

, -
remains -
a -

problem -
in -
Asian -
countries -

Recent -
development -
of -

is -
reported -
to -
be -
successful -
in -
reducing -

although -
the -
standard -
medical -
therapies -
have -
not -
been -
established -
up -

In -
this -
report -
, -
we -
encountered -
a -
patient -
with -
decompensated -
HBV -
- -
related -
cirrhosis D005355
who -
exhibited -
the -
dramatic -
improvements -
after -
antiviral -
therapy -
. -

The -
patient -
was -
a -
50 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
woman -
. -

Previous -
conventional -
medical -
treatments -
were -
not -
effective -
for -
this -
patient -
, -
thus -
this -
patient -
had -
been -
referred -
to -
our -
hospital -
. -

However -
, -
the -
administration -
of -
lamivudine -
, -
a -
reverse -
transcriptase -
inhibitor -
, -
for -
23 -
months -
dramatically -
improved -
her -
liver -
severity -
. -

During -
this -
period -
, -
no -
drug -
resistant -
mutant -
HBV -
emerged -
, -
and -
the -
serum -
HBV -
- -
DNA -
level -
was -
continuously -
suppressed -
. -

These -
virological -
responses -
were -
also -
maintained -
even -
after -
the -
antiviral -
therapy -
was -
discontinued -
. -

Moreover -
, -
both -
hepatitis -
B -
surface -
antigen -
and -
e -
antigen -
were -
observed -
to -
have -
disappeared -
in -
this -
patient -
. -

The -
administration -
of -
lamivudine -
to -
patients -
with -
HBV -
- -
related -
cirrhosis D005355
, -
like -
our -
present -
case -
, -
should -
be -
considered -
as -
an -
initial -
medical -
therapeutic -
option -

especially -
in -
countries -
where -
liver -
transplantation -
is -

Dual -

Melatonin -
affects -
the -
circadian -
sleep -

cycle -
, -
but -
it -
is -
not -
clear -
whether -
it -
may -
influence -
drug -
- -
induced -

Sodium -
thiopenthal -
was -

Melatonin -
pre -
- -
treatment -
affected -
in -
a -
dual -
manner -
barbiturate -
narcosis D053608
, -
however -
, -
no -
dose -
- -
effect -
correlation -
was -
found -
. -

In -
particular -
, -
low -
doses -
reduced -
the -
latency -
to -
and -
prolonged -
the -
duration -
of -
barbiturate -
narcosis D053608
. -

In -
contrast -
, -
the -
highest -
dose -
of -
melatonin -
( -
50 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
) -
caused -
a -
paradoxical -
increase -
in -
the -
latency -
and -
produced -
a -
sustained -
reduction -
of -
the -
duration -
of -
narcosis D053608
, -
and -
a -
reduction -
in -
mortality -
rate -
. -

Melatonin -
0 -
. -
5 -
and -
5 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
influenced -
the -
duration -
but -
not -
the -
latency -
of -
ketamine -
- -
or -
diazepam -
- -
induced -
narcosis D053608
. -

Thus -
, -
the -
dual -
action -
of -
melatonin -
on -
pharmacological -
narcosis D053608
seems -
to -
be -
specific -
for -
the -
barbiturate -
mechanism -

INTRODUCTION -
: -
Ethambutol -
is -
used -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
tuberculosis D014376
, -
which -
is -
still -
prevalent -
in -
Southeast -
Asia -
, -
and -
can -
be -
associated -
with -
permanent -
visual D014786
loss -
. -

We -
report -
3 -
cases -
which -
presented -
with -
bitemporal D006423
hemianopia -
. -

CLINICAL -
PICTURE -
: -
Three -
patients -
with -
ethambutol -
- -
associated -
toxic -
optic D009901
neuropathy -
are -
described -
. -

All -
3 -
patients -
had -
loss D014786
of -
central -
visual -
acuity -
, -
colour -
vision -
( -
Ishihara -
) -
and -
visual -
field -
. -

The -
visual D014786
field -
loss -
had -
a -
bitemporal -
flavour -
, -
suggesting -
involvement -
of -
the -
optic -
chiasm -
. -

TREATMENT -
: -
Despite -
stopping -
ethambutol -
on -
diagnosis -
, -
visual -
function -
continued -
to -
deteriorate -
for -
a -
few -
months -
. -

Subsequent -
improvement -
was -
mild -
in -
2 -
cases -
. -

In -
the -
third -
case -
, -
visual -
acuity -
and -
colour -
vision -
normalised -
but -
the -
optic -
discs -
were -
pale -
. -

OUTCOME -
: -
All -
3 -
patients -
had -
some -
permanent -
loss D014786
of -
visual -
function -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Ethambutol -
usage -
is -
associated -
with -
permanent -
visual D014786
loss -
and -
should -
be -
avoided -

The -
author -
postulates -
that -
in -
cases -
of -
ethambutol -
associated -
chiasmopathy -
, -
ethambutol -
may -
initially -
affect -
the -
optic -
nerves -

Previous -
studies -
evaluated -
the -
tolerance -
of -
nimesulide -
and -
paracetamol -
in -
subjects -
with -
cutaneous -

respiratory -
and -
anaphylactoid -
reactions -
induced -
by -
nonsteroidal -
anti -
- -
inflammatory -
drugs -
( -
NSAIDs -
) -
. -

In -
this -
study -
we -
investigated -
tolerability -
and -
reliability -
of -
nimesulide -

paracetamol -
in -
a -
very -

we -
evaluated -
whether -
some -
factors -
have -
the -
potential -
to -
increase -
the -

Taken -

in -
patients -

However -
, -
the -

is -
statistically -
increased -
by -
a -

kept -

Our -

BACKGROUND -
: -
More -

3 -
decades -

( -

) -
reported -
on -
the -
devastation -
caused -
by -
alcohol -
exposure -
on -
fetal -
development -
, -
the -
rates -
of -
heavy -
drinking -
during -
pregnancy -
remain -
relatively -
unchanged -
. -

Early -
identification -
of -
fetal -
alcohol -
exposure -
and -
maternal -
abstinence -
led -
to -
better -
infant -
outcomes -
. -

This -

examined -
the -
utility -
of -

for -
detecting -
alcohol -

METHODS -
: -
We -
obtained -
fetal -
ultrasound -
measures -
from -
routine -
ultrasound -
examinations -
for -
167 -
pregnant -
hazardous -
drinkers -
who -
were -
enrolled -
in -
a -

intervention -
study -
. -

The -
fetal -
measures -
for -
women -
who -
quit -
after -
learning -
of -
their -
pregnancies -
were -
compared -
with -
measures -
for -
women -
who -
continued -
some -
drinking -
throughout -
the -
course -
of -
their -
pregnancies -
. -

Because -
intensity -
of -
alcohol -
consumption -
is -
associated -
with -
poorer -
fetal -
outcomes -
, -
separate -
analyses -
were -
conducted -
for -
the -
heavy -

Fetal -
measures -
from -
the -

a -
nondrinking -
group -
that -
was -
representative -
of -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Clinicians -
are -
exhorted -
to -
pay -
close -
attention -
when -

Identification -
of -
a -
simple -
and -
sensitive -
microplate -
method -
for -
the -
detection -
of -
oversulfated -
chondroitin -
sulfate -
in -
heparin -
products -
. -

Heparin -
is -
a -
commonly -
implemented -
anticoagulant -
used -
to -
treat -
critically -
ill -
patients -
. -

Recently -
, -
a -
number -
of -
commercial -
lots -
of -
heparin -
products -
were -
found -
to -
be -
contaminated -
with -
an -
oversulfated -
chondroitin -
sulfate -
( -
OSCS -
) -
derivative -
that -
could -
elicit -
a -
hypotensive D007022
response -
in -
pigs -
following -
a -
single -
high -
- -
dose -
infusion -
. -

Using -
both -
contaminated -
heparin -
products -
and -
the -
synthetically -
produced -
derivative -
, -
we -
showed -
that -
the -
OSCS -
produces -
dose -
- -
dependent -
hypotension D007022
in -
pigs -
. -

The -
no -
observed -
effect -
level -
( -
NOEL -
) -
for -
this -
contaminant -
appears -
to -
be -
approximately -
1mg -
/ -
kg -
, -
corresponding -
to -
a -
contamination -
level -
of -
approximately -
3 -
% -
. -

We -
also -
demonstrated -
that -
OSCS -
can -
be -
identified -
in -
heparin -
products -
using -
a -
simple -
, -
inexpensive -
, -
commercially -
available -
heparin -
enzyme -
immunoassay -
( -
EIA -
) -
kit -
that -
has -
a -
limit -
of -
detection -
of -
approximately -
0 -
. -
1 -
% -
, -
well -
below -
the -
NOEL -
. -

This -
kit -
may -
provide -
a -
useful -
method -
to -
test -
heparin -
products -
for -
contamination -
with -
oversulfated -

Clinical -
use -

by -
its -
cardiotoxic D066126

which -
are -

To -
elucidate -
the -
possible -
role -
of -
the -
kinin -
B1 -
receptor -
( -
B1R -
) -
during -
the -
development -
of -
DOX -
cardiomyopathy D009202

we -
studied -
B1R -

by -
investigating -
cardiac -
inflammation D007249
and -
apoptosis -
after -
induction -
of -
DOX -
- -
induced -
cardiomyopathy D009202
. -

DOX -
control -
mice -
showed -
cardiac D006331
dysfunction -
measured -
by -
pressure -
- -
volume -
loops -
in -
vivo -
. -

This -
was -
associated -
with -
a -
reduced -
activation -
state -
of -
AKT -
, -
as -
well -
as -
an -
increased -
bax -

bcl2 -
ratio -
in -
Western -
blots -
, -
indicating -
cardiac D006331
apoptosis -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
mRNA -
levels -
of -
the -
proinflammatory -
cytokine -
interleukin -
6 -
were -
increased -
in -
the -
cardiac -
tissue -
. -

In -
DOX -
B1R -
( -
- -

- -
) -
mice -
, -
cardiac D006331
dysfunction -
was -
improved -
compared -
to -
DOX -
control -
mice -
, -
which -
was -
associated -
with -
normalization -
of -
the -
bax -

bcl -
- -
2 -
ratio -
and -
interleukin -
6 -
, -
as -
well -
as -

activation -
state -
. -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -
B1R -
is -
detrimental -
in -
DOX -
cardiomyopathy D009202
in -
that -
it -
mediates -
the -
inflammatory -
response -
and -

These -
insights -
might -
have -
useful -
implications -
for -

Using -
a -
positron -
emission -
tomography -
( -
PET -
) -
study -
it -
was -
shown -
recently -
that -
in -
migraine D008881
without -
aura -
certain -
areas -
in -
the -
brain -
stem -
were -
activated -
during -
the -
headache D006261
state -
, -
but -
not -
in -
the -
headache D006261
free -
interval -
. -

It -
was -
suggested -
that -
this -
brain -
stem -
activation -
is -
inherent -
to -
the -
migraine D008881
attack -
itself -
and -
represents -
the -
so -
called -
' -
migraine D008881
generator -
' -
. -

To -
test -
this -
hypothesis -
we -
performed -
an -
experimental -
pain D010146
study -
in -
seven -
healthy -
volunteers -
, -
using -
the -
same -
positioning -
in -
the -
PET -
scanner -
as -
in -
the -
migraine D008881
patients -
. -

A -
small -
amount -
of -
capsaicin -
was -
administered -
subcutaneously -
in -
the -
right -
forehead -
to -
evoke -
a -
burning -
painful D010146
sensation -
in -
the -
first -
division -
of -
the -
trigeminal -
nerve -
. -

Increases -
of -
regional -
cerebral -

were -
found -
bilaterally -
in -

, -
in -
the -
anterior -
cingulate -
cortex -
, -
the -
cavernous -
sinus -
and -

Using -
the -

stereotactic -
space -
limits -
as -
in -
the -
above -
mentioned -
migraine D008881
study -
no -
brain -

was -
found -
in -
the -
acute -

The -
increase -
of -
activation -
in -
the -
region -
of -
the -
cavernous -
sinus -
however -
, -
suggests -
that -
this -
structure -
is -
more -
likely -
to -
be -
involved -
in -
trigeminal -

Neuroleptic D009459
malignant -

Neuroleptic D009459
malignant -
syndrome -
is -
thought -
to -
be -
a -
result -
of -
dopamine -
D2 -
receptor -
blockade -
in -
the -
striatum -
of -
the -
basal -
ganglia -
. -

Risperidone -
, -
a -
benzisoxazole -
derivative -
antipsychotic -
, -
has -
high -
serotonin -
5 -
- -
HT2 -
receptor -
blockade -
and -
dose -
- -
related -
D2 -
receptor -
blockade -
. -

The -
high -
ratio -
is -
believed -
to -
impart -
the -
low -
frequency -
of -
extrapyramidal D001480
symptoms -
with -
risperidone -
at -
low -
dosages -
. -

With -
this -
low -
frequency -
of -
extrapyramidal D001480
symptoms -
, -
it -
was -
thought -
the -
frequency -
of -
neuroleptic D009459
malignant -
syndrome -
might -
also -
be -
lowered -

syndrome -
reversed -
after -
discontinuing -
risperidone -
and -
starting -
treatment -
with -

It -
appears -
that -
the -

effects -
observed -
with -

does -
not -

required -
a -
total -
of -
4 -
laboratory -
visits -

in -

were -
2 -

These -

The -
percentage -
of -

in -
whom -

Consequently -
, -

, -
33 -

achieved -
hypertensive D006973

Thus -
, -
in -
borderline -
hypertensive D006973
men -
, -
exaggerated -

were -
: -
selective -
for -

We -
suspect -
that -
the -
potential -
for -
caffeine -
to -
stabilize -
high -
resistance -
states -
in -
susceptible -
persons -
suggests -
that -
its -
use -
may -
facilitate -

Cardiac -
transplantation -
: -
improved -
quality -
of -
survival -
with -
a -
modified -
immunosuppressive -
protocol -
. -

The -
effects -
on -
renal -
function -
on -
two -
different -
immunosuppressive -
protocols -
were -
evaluated -
retrospectively -
in -
two -
subsequent -
groups -
of -
heart -
transplant -
recipients -
. -

In -
group -
I -
, -
cyclosporine -
was -
given -
before -
the -
procedure -
at -
a -
loading -
dose -
of -
17 -
. -
5 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
and -
then -
continued -
after -
the -
procedure -
to -
keep -
a -
whole -
blood -
level -
about -
1000 -
ng -
/ -
ml -
. -

In -
group -
II -
, -
cyclosporine -
was -
started -
only -
after -
the -
procedure -
at -
a -
lower -
dosage -
and -
was -
complemented -
by -
azathioprine -
, -
which -
was -
used -
for -
the -
first -
postoperative -
week -
. -

Group -
II -
showed -
a -
better -
perioperative -
renal -
function -
as -
determined -
by -
serum -
blood -
urea -
nitrogen -
and -
serum -
creatinine -
levels -
. -

Group -
II -
also -
showed -
a -
significant -
decrease -
of -
chronic -
nephrotoxicity D007674
secondary -
to -
long -
- -
term -
therapy -
with -
cyclosporine -
. -

Despite -
this -
improvement -
in -
late -
renal -
function -
, -
group -
II -
still -
shows -
a -
slow -
rise -
in -
serum -
creatinine -
. -

We -
think -
that -
even -
these -
lower -
dosages -
of -
cyclosporine -
can -
cause -
chronic -
nephrotoxicity D007674
and -
that -
further -
modification -
of -
the -
immunosuppressive -
regimen -
is -
required -
to -
completely -
abolish -
this -
toxic -
side -
effect -

A -
67 -

patient -
, -
with -
primary -
polymyositis D017285
and -
without -

, -
developed -
clinical -

biochemical -
features -
of -
severe -
cholestasis D002779
3 -
months -
after -
initiation -
of -
azathioprine -

. -

Liver -
biopsy -
showed -
cholestasis D002779
with -
both -
cytological -
and -
architectural -
alterations -
of -
interlobular -
bile -

Azathioprine -
withdrawal -
resulted -
after -
7 -
weeks -
in -
the -
resolution -
of -
clinical -

It -
is -
believed -
that -
this -
is -
the -
first -
reported -

Glomerular -

GFR -

ERPF -
decreased -
with -
the -
induction -
of -

but -
not -
significantly -
more -
during -
hypotension D007022

Postoperatively -
, -
ERPF -
returned -
to -
preoperative -
values -

Renal -

decreased -
when -
hypotension D007022
was -
induced -
, -
allowing -
the -
maintenance -
of -
renal -

We -
conclude -
that -
renal -
compensatory -
mechanisms -
are -
preserved -
during -
isoflurane -
- -
induced -
hypotension D007022
and -
that -
renal -

has -
been -
described -
primarily -
in -

We -
describe -
a -
patient -
who -
developed -
anemia D000740
while -
receiving -

s -
serum -
and -
in -
an -
eluate -
prepared -
from -

The -
eluate -
also -
reacted -
weakly -
with -
red -
blood -
cells -
in -
the -
absence -
of -
cefotetan -
, -
suggesting -
the -
concomitant -
formation -
of -

observations -
, -
in -

Toxicities D064420
included -
hepatotoxicity D056486
, -
malaise D005221
, -
and -
dose -
- -
limiting -
nephrotoxicity D007674
. -

This -
latter -
effect -
is -
thought -
to -
be -
due -
to -
drug -
precipitation -
within -
the -
renal -
tubule -
as -
a -
result -
of -
the -
poor -

of -
CB -

under -
acidic -
conditions -
. -

In -
an -
attempt -
to -
overcome -
this -
problem -
, -
a -
clinical -
trial -
of -
CB -
3717 -
administered -
with -
alkaline -

is -
under -
way -
. -

Preliminary -
results -
at -
400 -

suggest -
that -
a -
reduction -
in -

may -
have -
been -
achieved -
with -
only -
1 -
instance -
of -

Hepatotoxicity D056486

that -

Ethopropazine -
and -
benztropine -
in -
neuroleptic -

induced -
parkinsonism D010302
. -

In -
a -
12 -
- -
week -
controlled -
study -
ethopropazine -
was -
compared -
to -
benztropine -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
parkinsonism D010302
induced -
by -
fluphenazine -
enanthate -
in -
60 -
schizophrenic D012559
outpatients -
. -

Ethopropazine -
and -
benztropine -
were -
found -
to -
be -
equally -
effective -
in -
controlling -
parkinsonian D010302
symptoms -
and -
were -
as -
efficacious -
as -
procyclidine -
, -
their -
previous -
antiparkinsonian -
drug -
. -

However -
, -
benztropine -
treated -
patients -
had -
a -
significant -
increase -
in -
tardive D004409
dyskinesia -
compared -
to -
their -
condition -
during -
procyclindine -
treatment -
, -
and -
significantly -
more -
anxiety D001008
and -
depression D003866
than -
ethopropazine -
treated -
patients -
. -

This -
suggests -
that -
benztropine -
is -
not -
the -
anticholinergic -
drug -
of -
choice -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
parkinsonian D010302

, -
because -
of -
its -
more -

Effect -

Methamphetamine -
( -

neurotoxicity D020258
is -
believed -
to -
be -
associated -
with -
the -

with -
MA -
( -
10 -

The -

intraperitoneally -
for -

DFO -
( -

administration -
. -

The -
concentrations -
of -
dopamine -
( -
DA -
) -
, -
serotonin -
and -
their -
metabolites -
decreased -
significantly -
after -
MA -
administration -
, -
which -
was -
inhibited -
by -
the -
alpha -

TC -
and -
DFO -
pretreatment -

MA -
- -
induced -
hyperthermia D005334
as -
well -
as -
the -
alterations -
in -
the -
locomotor -
activity -

The -
level -
of -
lipid -

was -
higher -
and -
the -
reduced -
glutathione -
concentration -
was -
lower -
in -
the -

. -

These -
changes -
were -
significantly -
attenuated -
by -
alpha -
- -
TC -
and -
DFO -

This -
suggests -
that -
alpha -
- -
TC -
and -
DFO -
ameliorate -
the -
MA -
- -
induced -
neuronal D009422
damage -
by -
decreasing -

BACKGROUND -
: -
In -
recent -
studies -
increased -
amounts -
of -
nitric -
oxide -
( -
NO -
) -
and -
apoptosis -
have -
been -
implicated -
in -
various -
pathological -
conditions -
in -
the -
kidney -
. -

We -
have -
studied -
the -
role -
of -
NO -
and -
its -
association -
with -
apoptosis -
in -
an -
experimental -
model -
of -
nephrotic D009404
syndrome -
induced -
by -
a -
single -
injection -
of -
adriamycin -
( -
ADR -
) -
. -

METHODS -
: -
The -
alteration -
in -
the -
NO -
pathway -
was -
assessed -
by -
measuring -
nitrite -
levels -
in -
serum -
/ -
urine -
and -
by -
evaluating -
the -
changes -
in -
vascular -
reactivity -
of -
the -
isolated -
perfused -
rat -
kidney -
( -
IPRK -
) -
system -
. -

Rats -
were -
stratified -
into -
control -
groups -
and -
ADR -
- -
induced -
nephropathy D007674
groups -
. -

These -
two -
groups -
were -
then -
divided -
into -
: -
group -
1 -
, -
animals -
receiving -
saline -
; -
and -
group -
2 -
, -
animals -
receiving -
aminoguanidine -
( -
AG -
) -
which -
is -
a -
specific -
inhibitor -
of -
inducible -
- -
NO -
synthase -
. -

On -
day -
21 -
, -
rats -
were -
sacrificed -
after -
obtaining -
material -
for -
biochemical -
analysis -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Histopathological -
examination -
of -
the -
kidneys -
of -
rats -
treated -
with -
ADR -
revealed -
focal -
areas -
of -
mesangial C537346
proliferation -
and -
mild -
tubulointerstitial D009395
inflammation -
. -

They -
also -
had -
significantly -
higher -
levels -
of -
proteinuria D011507
compared -
with -
control -
and -
treatment -
groups -
( -
P -
< -
0 -
. -
05 -
) -
. -

Urine -
nitrite -
levels -
were -
significantly -
increased -
in -
the -
ADR -
- -
nephropathy D007674
group -
( -
P -
< -
0 -
. -
05 -
) -
. -

In -
the -
IPRK -
phenylephrine -
and -
acetylcholine -
related -
responses -
were -
significantly -
impaired -
in -
the -
ADR -
- -
nephropathy D007674
group -
. -

Apoptosis -
was -
not -
detected -
in -
controls -
. -

However -
, -
in -
the -
ADR -
- -
nephropathy D007674
group -
, -
numerous -
apoptotic -
cells -
were -
identified -
in -
the -
tubulointerstitial -
areas -
. -

Double -
staining -
revealed -
numerous -
interstitial -
apoptotic -
cells -
to -
stain -
for -
ED1 -
, -
a -
marker -
for -
monocytes -
/ -
macrophages -
. -

Treatment -
with -
AG -
prevented -
the -
impairment -
of -
renal -
vascular -
bed -
responses -
and -
reduced -
both -
urine -
nitrite -
levels -
and -
apoptosis -
to -
control -
levels -
. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
We -
suggest -
that -
interactions -
between -
NO -
and -
apoptosis -
are -
important -
in -
the -
pathogenesis -
of -
the -
ADR -
- -
induced -
nephrosis D009401

It -
is -
known -
that -
beta -
- -
adrenoceptor -

are -
effective -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
akathisia D017109
, -
one -

that -
occur -
during -

Neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
catalepsy D002375
, -
a -
model -
of -
neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
extrapyramidal -
side -
effects -
, -
was -
considered -
suitable -
as -
a -
model -
for -
predicting -
neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
akathisia D017109
in -
humans -
, -
although -
neuroleptic -
- -

was -
not -
considered -
a -
specific -
test -
for -

. -

Therefore -
, -
the -
effects -
of -
carteolol -
, -
a -
beta -
- -
adrenoceptor -
antagonist -
, -
on -
haloperidol -
- -
induced -
catalepsy D002375
in -
rats -
were -
behaviorally -
studied -
and -
compared -
with -
those -
of -
propranolol -
and -
biperiden -
, -
a -
muscarinic -
receptor -
antagonist -
. -

Carteolol -
, -
as -
well -
as -
propranolol -
and -
biperiden -
, -
inhibited -
the -
haloperidol -
- -
induced -
catalepsy D002375
. -

The -
inhibitory -
effect -
of -
carteolol -
was -
almost -
comparable -
to -
that -
of -
propranolol -
, -
but -
was -
weaker -
than -
that -
of -
biperiden -
. -

Carteolol -
did -
not -
evoke -
postsynaptic -
dopamine -
receptor -
- -
stimulating -
behavioral -
signs -
such -
as -
stereotypy -
and -
hyperlocomotion D009069
in -
rats -
. -

Carteolol -
did -
not -
antagonize -
the -
inhibitory -
effects -
of -
haloperidol -
on -
apomorphine -
- -
induced -
stereotypy -
and -
locomotor -
activity -
in -
rats -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
carteolol -
did -
not -
evoke -
5 -
- -
HT1A -
receptor -
- -
stimulating -
behavioral -
signs -
such -
as -
flat -
body -
posture -
and -
forepaw -
treading -
and -
did -
not -
inhibit -
5 -
- -
hydroxytryptophan -
- -
induced -
head -
twitch -
in -
rats -
. -

Finally -
, -
carteolol -
did -
not -
inhibit -
physostigmine -
- -
induced -
lethality -
in -
rats -
. -

These -
results -
strongly -
suggest -
that -
carteolol -
improves -
haloperidol -
- -
induced -
catalepsy D002375
via -
its -
beta -
- -
adrenoceptor -
antagonistic -
activity -
and -
is -
expected -
to -
be -
effective -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
akathisia D017109
without -
attenuating -
neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
antipsychotic -
effects -
due -
to -
its -
postsynaptic -
dopamine -

activity -

As -
heroin -
addicts -
sometimes -
faint -

drugs -
, -
doctors -
might -
attribute -
too -
many -

use -
and -
thereby -
underestimate -
the -

population -
, -
and -
the -
high -

Dopamine -

It -
is -
widely -
believed -
that -
dopamine -
( -
DA -
) -
mediates -
methamphetamine -
( -
METH -
) -
- -
induced -
toxicity D064420
to -
brain -
dopaminergic -
neurons -
, -
because -
drugs -
that -
interfere -
with -
DA -
neurotransmission -
decrease -
toxicity D064420
, -
whereas -
drugs -
that -
increase -
DA -
neurotransmission -
enhance -
toxicity D064420
. -

However -
, -
temperature -
effects -
of -
drugs -
that -
have -
been -
used -
to -
manipulate -
brain -
DA -
neurotransmission -
confound -
interpretation -
of -
the -
data -
. -

Here -
we -
show -
that -
the -
recently -
reported -
ability -
of -
L -
- -
dihydroxyphenylalanine -
to -
reverse -
the -
protective -
effect -
of -
alpha -
- -
methyl -
- -
para -
- -
tyrosine -
on -
METH -
- -
induced -
DA -
neurotoxicity D020258
is -
also -
confounded -
by -
drug -
effects -
on -
body -
temperature -
. -

Further -
, -
we -
show -
that -
mice -
genetically -
engineered -
to -
be -
deficient -
in -
brain -
DA -
develop -
METH -
neurotoxicity D020258
, -
as -
long -
as -
the -
thermic -
effects -
of -
METH -
are -
preserved -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
we -
demonstrate -
that -
mice -
genetically -
engineered -
to -
have -
unilateral -
brain -
DA -
deficits -
develop -
METH -
- -
induced -
dopaminergic D009461
deficits -
that -
are -
of -
comparable -
magnitude -
on -
both -
sides -
of -
the -
brain -
. -

Taken -
together -
, -
these -
findings -
demonstrate -
that -
DA -
is -
not -
essential -
for -
the -
development -
of -
METH -
- -
induced -
dopaminergic -

OBJECTIVE -
: -
Diabetic D003928
nephropathy -
is -
one -
of -
the -
major -
causes -
of -
renal D051437
failure -
, -
which -
is -
accompanied -
by -
the -
production -
of -
reactive -

the -
primary -
transcription -

that -
controls -
the -

for -
maintaining -

RESEARCH -
DESIGN -
AND -
METHODS -
: -
We -
explore -
the -
protective -
role -
of -
Nrf2 -
against -
diabetic D003928
nephropathy -
using -
human -
kidney -
biopsy -

Nrf2 -
( -

. -

RESULTS -
: -
The -
glomeruli -
of -
human -
diabetic D003928
nephropathy -
patients -
were -
under -
oxidative -
stress -
and -
had -
elevated -
Nrf2 -
levels -
. -

In -
the -
animal -
study -
, -
Nrf2 -
was -
demonstrated -
to -
be -
crucial -
in -
ameliorating -
streptozotocin -
- -
induced -
renal D058186
damage -
. -

This -
is -
evident -
by -
Nrf2 -
( -

- -
) -
mice -
having -
higher -
ROS -
production -
and -
suffering -
from -
greater -

damage -
and -
renal D058186

compared -
with -

) -
mice -
. -

Mechanistic -
studies -
in -
both -
in -
vivo -
and -
in -

systems -
showed -
that -
the -
Nrf2 -
- -
mediated -
protection -
against -
diabetic D003928
nephropathy -
is -
, -
at -
least -
, -
partially -
through -
inhibition -
of -
transforming -
growth -
factor -
- -
beta1 -
( -
TGF -
- -

) -
and -
reduction -
of -

In -
human -
renal -
mesangial -
cells -
, -
high -
glucose -
induced -
ROS -
production -
and -
activated -
expression -
of -
Nrf2 -
and -
its -
downstream -
genes -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
activation -
or -
overexpression -
of -
Nrf2 -
inhibited -
the -
promoter -
activity -
of -
TGF -
- -
beta1 -
in -
a -
dose -
- -
dependent -
manner -
, -
whereas -
knockdown -
of -
Nrf2 -
by -
siRNA -
enhanced -
TGF -

beta1 -
transcription -
and -
fibronectin -
production -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
This -
work -
clearly -
indicates -
a -
protective -
role -
of -
Nrf2 -
in -
diabetic D003928
nephropathy -
, -
suggesting -
that -
dietary -
or -
therapeutic -
activation -
of -
Nrf2 -
could -
be -
used -
as -
a -
strategy -
to -
prevent -

BACKGROUND -
: -
In -

Hemolytic D006463
- -
uremic -

is -
a -
newly -
described -
phenomenon -
, -
with -
just -
two -
previous -
descriptions -
of -
4 -
cases -
in -
the -
literature -

We -
describe -
a -
5th -

the -

that -
this -
is -
the -
first -

To -
further -
our -

we -
examined -
in -

The -
results -

that -

not -
selective -
for -

was -
observed -
in -

These -

suggest -
that -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Although -
our -
findings -
support -
the -
observation -
that -
dexrazoxane -
reduces -
neither -
hematologic -
activity -
nor -
antitumor -
activity -
from -
doxorubicin -
clinically -
, -
the -
potent -
antagonism -
of -
daunorubicin -
activity -
raises -
concern -
; -
a -
possible -
interference -
with -
anticancer -
efficacy -
certainly -
would -
call -
for -
renewed -
attention -
. -

Our -
data -
also -
suggest -
that -
significant -
etoposide -
dose -
escalation -
is -
perhaps -
possible -
by -
the -
use -
of -
dexrazoxane -
. -

In -
contrast -
, -
the -

However -
, -
the -
pharmacological -
profiles -

. -

The -
present -
study -
investigated -
the -
effects -
of -
putative -
anxiogenic -
drugs -
on -
LES -
and -
FPS -
and -
aimed -
at -
determining -
the -
sensitivity -
of -
LES -
for -
anxiogenic -
drugs -
and -
to -
potentially -
showing -
a -
pharmacological -

RESULTS -
: -
None -

, -
whereas -
mCPP -
increased -

Furthermore -
, -
yohimbine -
increased -

while -
mCPP -
suppressed -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
In -
contrast -
to -
findings -
in -
the -

paradigm -
, -
none -
of -
the -
drugs -
were -
able -
to -

The -

As -

However -
, -
there -

after -
5 -
months -
of -

treatment -
( -

The -
tic D013981
- -

completely -
after -
we -
reduced -
the -
dose -
of -

However -
, -
her -

We -
then -
placed -
her -
on -
an -
additional -
100 -

She -
has -
been -

Together -
with -

Apomorphine -

Apomorphine -

first -
dopaminergic -
drug -
ever -
used -
to -
treat -
symptoms -
of -
Parkinson D010300

While -
powerful -
antiparkinsonian -
effects -
had -

the -

of -
treating -
fluctuating -
Parkinson D010300

by -

of -
apomorphine -
has -
only -
recently -

the -
subject -
of -
systematic -
study -

A -
number -
of -
small -
scale -
clinical -
trials -
have -
unequivocally -
shown -
that -
intermittent -
subcutaneous -
apomorphine -
injections -
produce -
antiparkinsonian -
benefit -
close -
if -
not -
identical -
to -
that -
seen -
with -

that -
apomorphine -

reliably -
revert -

50 -

in -
this -
group -
of -

which -
appears -
to -
be -
a -

demonstrated -
long -
- -
term -
persistence -
of -

In -

there -
is -
convincing -

A -

side -
effect -
associated -

The -
pathogenesis -
of -
this -
myalgia D063806
is -
still -
unclear -
; -
inflammation D007249
has -
been -
suggested -
but -
without -
convincing -
evidence -
. -

We -
designed -
the -
present -
study -
to -
investigate -
whether -
an -
inflammatory -
reaction -
contributes -
to -
this -
myalgia D063806
. -

The -
incidence -
and -
severity -
of -
succinylcholine -

myalgia D063806
was -
determined -
in -
64 -

or -
dexamethasone -
before -
succinylcholine -
( -
n -
= -

) -
. -

Incidence -
and -
severity -
of -
myalgia D063806
did -
not -
differ -
significantly -
between -
the -
two -
groups -
: -
15 -
patients -
in -
the -
dexamethasone -
group -
complained -
of -
myalgia D063806
compared -
with -
18 -
patients -
in -
the -
saline -
group -
, -
and -
severe -
myalgia D063806
was -
reported -
by -
five -
patients -
and -
three -
patients -
, -
respectively -
( -
not -
significant -
) -
. -

At -
48 -
h -
after -
surgery -
, -
12 -
patients -
in -
both -
groups -
still -
suffered -
from -

. -

In -
addition -
, -
interleukin -
- -
6 -
( -
IL -
- -

) -
as -
an -
early -
marker -
of -
inflammation D007249
was -
assessed -
in -
a -
subgroup -
of -
10 -
patients -
pretreated -
with -
saline -
. -

We -
found -
an -
increase -
of -
IL -
- -
6 -
for -
only -
three -
patients -
, -
but -
only -
one -
patient -
reported -
myalgia D063806
; -
no -
relationship -
between -
myalgia D063806
and -
the -
increase -
of -
IL -
- -
6 -
was -
found -
. -

In -
conclusion -
, -
there -
is -
no -
evidence -
for -
an -
inflammatory -
origin -
of -
succinylcholine -
- -
associated -
myalgia D063806
. -

IMPLICATIONS -
: -
Administration -
of -
dexamethasone -
before -
succinylcholine -
was -
not -
effective -
in -
decreasing -
the -
incidence -
or -
the -
severity -
of -
succinylcholine -
- -
induced -
postoperative D010149
myalgia -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
there -
was -
no -
significant -
relationship -

Pregnenolone -
sulphate -
( -
PREGS -
) -
has -
generated -
interest -
as -
one -
of -
the -
most -
potent -
memory -

neurosteroids -
to -
be -
examined -
in -
rodent -
learning -
studies -
, -
with -
particular -
importance -
in -
the -
ageing -
process -
. -

The -
mechanism -
by -
which -
this -
endogenous -
steroid -
enhances -
memory -
formation -
is -
hypothesized -
to -
involve -
actions -
on -
glutamatergic -
and -
GABAergic -
systems -
. -

This -
hypothesis -
stems -
from -
findings -
that -
PREGS -
is -
a -
potent -
positive -
modulator -
of -
N -
- -
methyl -
- -
d -
- -
aspartate -

Moreover -
, -
PREGS -
is -
able -
to -

effects -
of -

To -
investigate -
this -
hypothesis -
, -
the -
present -
study -
in -

examined -
the -
memory -

The -
memory -
- -
enhancing -

of -
PREGS -
and -
its -

were -
tested -
in -
the -
passive -
avoidance -
task -
using -
the -
model -
of -
scopolamine -
- -
induced -
amnesia D000647
. -

Both -
PREGS -
and -
its -
( -
- -
) -
enantiomer -
blocked -
the -
effects -
of -
scopolamine -
. -

The -
results -
show -
that -
, -
unlike -
PREGS -
, -
11 -
- -
ketopregnenolone -
sulphate -
and -
epipregnanolone -
sulphate -
failed -
to -
block -
the -
effect -
of -
scopolamine -
, -
suggesting -
that -
altering -
the -
modulation -
of -
NMDA -
receptors -
diminishes -
the -
memory -
- -
enhancing -
effects -
of -
PREGS -
. -

Moreover -
, -
enantioselectivity -
was -
demonstrated -
by -
the -
ability -
of -
natural -
PREGS -
to -
be -
an -
order -
of -
magnitude -
more -
effective -
than -
its -
synthetic -
enantiomer -
in -
reversing -
scopolamine -
- -

a -

Amiodarone -
pulmonary D008171
toxicity -

Amiodarone -
is -
an -
effective -
antiarrhythmic -
agent -
whose -
utility -
is -
limited -
by -
many -
side -
- -
effects -

the -
most -
problematic -
being -
pneumonitis D011014
. -

The -
pulmonary D008171
toxicity -
of -
amiodarone -
is -
thought -
to -
result -
from -
direct -
injury -

T -

The -
clinical -

radiographic -
features -
of -
amiodarone -
- -
induced -
pulmonary D008171
toxicity -
are -
characteristic -
but -
nonspecific -
. -

The -
diagnosis -
depends -
on -
exclusion -
of -

, -
such -
as -
heart D006333

, -
infection D007239

While -

improvement -
in -

cases -
, -
this -
is -
not -
always -
possible -
or -

may -
have -
a -
role -

Chlorthalidone -
( -

All -

In -
both -
groups -
a -
potassium -

developed -
, -
with -
proportionally -
larger -

from -
the -

from -
the -

In -
the -

was -
176 -

in -
the -

was -
276 -

The -

It -
is -
concluded -
that -

interpreted -
as -
a -
benign -

There -
was -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Use -
of -
the -
Naranjo -
probability -
scale -
indicates -
a -
probable -
relationship -
between -
the -
use -
of -
fluconazole -
and -
the -
development -
of -
TDP D016171
. -

The -
possible -
mechanism -
is -
depression D003866
of -
rapidly -
activating -
delayed -
rectifier -
potassium -
currents -
. -

In -
our -
patient -
, -
there -
was -
no -
other -
etiology -
identified -
that -
could -
explain -
QT D008133
prolongation -
or -
TDP D016171
The -
complete -
disappearance -
of -
NSVT D017180

premature D018879
ventricular -
contractions -
followed -
by -
normalization -
of -
QT -
interval -
after -
the -
drug -
was -
stopped -
strongly -
suggests -
fluconazole -
as -
the -
etiology -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Clinicians -
should -
be -
aware -
that -
fluconazole -
, -
even -
at -
low -
doses -
, -
may -
cause -
prolongation D008133
of -
the -
QT -
interval -
, -
leading -
to -
TDP D016171
. -

Serial -
electrocardiographic -

may -
be -

fluconazole -
is -
administered -
in -
patients -
who -
are -
at -
risk -
for -

Because -
of -
the -
National -
Acute -
Spinal D013119
Cord -
Injury -
Studies -
( -
NASCIS -
) -
, -
high -
- -
dose -
methylprednisolone -
became -
the -
standard -
of -
care -
for -
the -
acute -
spinal D013119
cord -
injury -
. -

In -
the -
NASCIS -
, -
there -
was -
no -
mention -
regarding -
the -
possibility -
of -
acute -
corticosteroid -
myopathy D009135
that -
high -
- -

methylprednisolone -
may -
cause -
. -

The -
dosage -
of -
methylprednisolone -
recommended -
by -
the -
NASCIS -
3 -
is -
the -
highest -
dose -
of -
steroids -
ever -
being -
used -
during -
a -
2 -
- -
day -
period -
for -
any -

We -
hypothesize -
that -
it -
may -
cause -
some -
damage D009135
to -
the -
muscle -
of -
spinal D013119

Further -
, -
steroid -

drugs -
that -
act -
on -
the -
cholinergic -
system -

However -
, -
epinephrine -

resulted -
in -
the -
incorporation -
of -

such -
that -
approximately -
40 -

catecholamine -
present -
was -
epinephrine -

Total -

In -
conclusion -
, -
chronic -
