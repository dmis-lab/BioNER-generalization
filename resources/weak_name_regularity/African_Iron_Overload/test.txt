In O
the O

numerous O
genes O
that O
influence O
iron O

have O
been O
discovered O
. O

Dr O

Beutler O
provides O
a O
brief O
overview O
of O
these O
genes O
, O
genes O
that O
encode O
HFE O
, O
DMT O
- O

, O
ferroportin O
, O
transferrin O
receptor O
2 O
, O
hephaestin O
, O
and O
hepcidin O
to O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
a O
discussion O
of O
the O
various O
clinical O
forms O
of O
iron O
storage O
disease O
and O
how O
they O
differ O
from O
one O
another O
. O

In O
Section O
I O
, O
Dr O
. O

Beutler O
also O
discusses O
the O
types O
of O
hemochromatosis O
that O
exist O
as O
acquired O
and O
as O
hereditary O
forms O
. O

Acquired O
hemochromatosis O
occurs O
in O
patients O
with O
marrow O
failure O
, O
particularly O
when O
there O
is O
active O
ineffective O
erythropoiesis O
. O

Hereditary O
hemochromatosis O
is O
most O
commonly O
due O
to O
mutations O
in O
the O
HLA O
- O
linked O
HFE O
gene O
, O
and O
hemochromatosis O
clinically O
indistinguishable O
from O
HFE O
hemochromatosis O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
mutations O
in O
three O
transferrin O
receptor O
- O
2 O
gene O
. O

A O
more O
severe O
, O
juvenile O
form O
of O
iron O
storage O
disease O
results O
from O
mutations O
of O
the O
gene O
encoding O
hepcidin O
or O
of O
a O
not O
- O
yet O
- O
identified O
gene O
on O
chromosome O
1q O
. O

Autosomal O
dominant O
iron O
storage O
disease O
is O
a O
consequence O
of O
ferroportin O
mutations O
, O
and O
a O
polymorphism O
in O
the O
ferroportin O
gene O
appears O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
African O
iron O
overload O
syndrome O
. O

Evidence O
regarding O
the O
biochemical O
and O
clinical O
penetrance O
of O
hemochromatosis O
due O
to O
mutations O
of O
the O
HFE O
gene O
is O
rapidly O
accumulating O
. O

These O
studies O
, O
emanating O
from O
several O
centers O
in O
Europe O
and O
the O
United O
States O
, O
all O
agree O
that O
the O
penetrance O
of O
hemochromatosis O
is O
much O
lower O
than O
had O
previously O
been O
thought O
. O

Probably O
only O
1 O
% O
of O
homozygotes O
develop O
clinical O
findings O
. O

The O
implications O
of O
these O
new O
findings O
for O
the O
management O
of O
hemochromatosis O
will O
be O
discussed O
. O

In O
Section O
II O
, O
Dr O

Victor O
Hoffbrand O
discusses O
the O
management O
of O
iron O
storage O
disease O
by O
chelation O
therapy O
, O
treatment O
that O
is O
usually O
reserved O
for O
patients O
with O
secondary O
hemochromatosis O
such O
as O
occurs O
in O
the O
thalassemias O
and O
in O
patients O
with O
transfusion O
requirements O
due O
to O
myelodysplasia O
and O
other O
marrow O
failure O
states O
. O

Tissue O
iron O
can O
be O
estimated O
by O
determining O
serum O
ferritin O
levels O
, O
measuring O
liver O
iron O
, O
and O
by O
measuring O
cardiac O
iron O
using O
the O
MRI O
- O
T2 O
* O
technique O
. O

The O
standard O
form O
of O
chelation O
therapy O
is O
the O
slow O
intravenous O
or O
subcutaneous O
infusion O
of O
desferoxamine O
. O

An O
orally O
active O
bidentate O
iron O
chelator O
, O
deferiprone O
, O
is O
now O
licensed O
in O
25 O
countries O
for O
treatment O
of O
patients O
with O
thalassemia O
major O
. O

Possibly O
because O
of O
the O
ability O
of O
this O
compound O
to O
cross O
membranes O
, O
it O
appears O
to O
have O
superior O
cardioprotective O
properties O
. O

Agranulocytosis O
is O
the O
most O
serious O
complication O
of O
deferiprone O
therapy O
and O
occurs O
in O
about O
1 O
% O
of O
treated O
patients O
. O

Deferiprone O
and O
desferoxamine O
can O
be O
given O
together O
or O
on O
alternating O
schedules O
. O

A O
new O
orally O
active O
chelating O
agent O
ICL O
670 O
seems O
promising O
in O
early O
clinical O
studies O
. O

In O
Section O
III O
, O
Dr O

James O
Cook O
discusses O
the O
most O
common O
disorder O
of O
iron O
homeostasis O
, O
iron O
deficiency O
. O

He O
will O
compare O
some O
of O
the O
standard O
methods O
for O
identifying O
iron O
deficiency O
, O
the O
hemoglobin O
level O
, O
transferrin O
saturation O
, O
and O
mean O
corpuscular O
hemoglobin O
and O
compare O
these O
with O
some O
of O
the O
newer O
methods O
that O
have O
been O
introduced O
, O
specifically O
the O
percentage O
of O
hypochromic O
erythrocytes O
and O
reticulocyte O
hemoglobin O
content O
. O

The O
measurement O
of O
storage O
iron O
is O
achieved O
by O
measuring O
serum O
ferritin O
levels O
. O

The O
soluble O
transferrin O
receptor O
is O
a O
truncated O
form O
of O
the O
cellular O
transferrin O
receptor O
and O
the O
possible O
value O
of O
this O
measurement O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
iron O
deficiency O
will O
be O
discussed O
. O

Until O
recently O
iron O
dextran O
was O
the O
only O
parental O
iron O
preparation O
available O
in O
the O
US O
. O

Sodium O
ferric O
gluconate O
, O
which O
has O
been O
used O
extensively O
in O
Europe O
for O
many O
years O
, O
is O
now O
available O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
distinct O
advantage O
over O
iron O
dextran O
in O
that O
anaphylactic O
reactions O
are O
much O
less O
common O
with O
the O
latter O
preparation O
. O

HLA O

linked O
hemochromatosis O
and O
other O
forms O
of O
iron O
overload O
. O

Inherited O
forms O
of O
iron O
overload O
are O
common O
. O

HLA O
- O
linked O
hemochromatosis O
and O
possibly O
African O
iron O
overload O
are O
associated O
with O
a O
significant O
risk O
of O
developing O
hepatocellular O
carcinoma O
. O

Early O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
, O
before O
substantial O
iron O
overloading O
occurs O
, O
reduces O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
. O

HLA O
- O
linked O
hemochromatosis O
is O
easily O
diagnosed O
, O
and O
routine O
screening O
in O
European O
- O
derived O
populations O
may O
be O
appropriate O
. O

Dissociation O
between O
tissue O
iron O
concentrations O
and O
transferrin O
saturation O
among O
inbred O
mouse O
strains O
. O

Excessive O
absorption O
of O
dietary O
iron O
results O
in O
pathologic O
hepatic O
iron O
accumulation O
in O
the O
genetic O
disorder O
hemochromatosis O
. O

Genetic O
factors O
have O
also O
been O
suggested O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
African O
iron O
overload O
that O
is O
induced O
by O
the O
intake O
of O
iron O
- O
rich O
fermented O
beer O
. O

We O
have O
used O
inbred O
strains O
of O
mice O
to O
investigate O
previously O
unrecognized O
genetic O
factors O
controlling O
iron O
metabolism O
. O

Among O
different O
strains O
of O
mice O
fed O
a O
basal O
iron O
diet O
, O
serum O
iron O
levels O
varied O
twofold O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
serum O
transferrin O
levels O
were O
remarkably O
constant O
. O

This O
indicates O
that O
transferrin O
saturation O
with O
iron O
, O
but O
not O
the O
serum O
level O
of O
transferrin O
, O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
genetically O
determined O
in O
mice O
. O

Hepatic O
iron O
stores O
also O
varied O
twofold O
among O
the O
different O
mouse O
strains O
. O

Remarkably O
, O
hepatic O
iron O
stores O
failed O
to O
reflect O
transferrin O
saturation O
, O
suggesting O
that O
different O
genetic O
factors O
control O
transferrin O
saturation O
and O
hepatic O
iron O
stores O
. O

When O
mice O
were O
challenged O
with O
a O
high O
- O
iron O
diet O
, O
the O
concentration O
of O
carbonyl O
iron O
required O
to O
completely O
saturate O
transferrin O
with O
iron O
was O
10 O
times O
greater O
for O
C57BL O
/ O
6 O
and O
BALB O
/ O
c O
mice O
than O
for O
DBA O
/ O
2 O
and O
AKR O
mice O
. O

These O
results O
are O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
iron O
- O
loading O
locus O
proposed O
to O
interact O
with O
dietary O
iron O
in O
African O
iron O
overload O
. O

Our O
studies O
with O
inbred O
strains O
of O
mice O
have O
revealed O
a O
number O
of O
novel O
control O
points O
in O
iron O
metabolism O
that O
may O
be O
genetically O
determined O
. O

The O
mouse O
model O
may O
thus O
be O
useful O
for O
understanding O
the O
molecular O
basis O
of O
hemochromatosis O
and O
African O
iron O
overload O
. O

The O
effect O
of O
the O
host O
' O
s O
iron O
status O
on O
tuberculosis O
. O

Several O
lines O
of O
evidence O
have O
suggested O
that O
iron O
is O
critical O
for O
Mycobacterium O
tuberculosis O
growth O
in O
macrophages O
. O

Macrophage O
iron O
loading O
in O
patients O
with O
African O
iron O
overload O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
tuberculosis O
( O
TB O
) O
and O
may O
worsen O
TB O
outcome O
. O

Likewise O
, O
macrophage O
iron O
loading O
may O
contribute O
to O
an O
increased O
predisposition O
toward O
TB O
in O
HIV O
infection O
. O

Human O
genetic O
disorders O
or O
variations O
may O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
TB O
or O
worsen O
its O
outcome O
through O
macrophage O
iron O
loading O
, O
including O
the O
haptoglobin O
2 O

2 O
phenotype O
, O
NRAMP1 O
polymorphisms O
( O
at O
least O
in O
Africans O
and O
Asians O
) O
, O
and O
possibly O
ferroportin O
1 O
mutations O
, O
but O
not O
HFE O
hemochromatosis O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
host O
' O
s O
iron O
status O
may O
be O
an O
important O
yet O
underevaluated O
factor O
in O
TB O

in O

dysfunction O
of O
the O
heart O

, O

Because O

are O
very O
limited O
, O
patients O

To O
examine O
the O

the O

Hereditary O

is O
associated O
with O
an O

The O

Recent O

suggest O
that O
the O

be O
much O

The O

The O

It O

whether O

The O

although O

the O

probably O
due O

however O

We O

that O

Evidence O

Iron O

in O
Africa O
was O
previously O
regarded O
as O
purely O
due O
to O
excessive O
iron O
in O
traditional O

but O
we O
recently O
found O
evidence O
that O
transferrin O

may O
be O
influenced O
by O
an O
interaction O
between O
dietary O

we O

For O
each O

African O
iron O
overload O
. O

Iron O
overload O
is O
common O
in O
rural O
sub O
- O
Saharan O
African O
populations O
that O
have O
the O
custom O
of O
drinking O
a O
traditional O
fermented O
beverage O
with O
high O
iron O
content O
. O

As O
with O
both O
excessive O
alcohol O
exposure O
and O
HFE O
hemochromatosis O
, O
hepatic O
portal O
fibrosis O
and O
micronodular O
cirrhosis O
are O
prominent O
sequelae O
of O
African O
iron O
overload O
. O

Two O
observations O
are O
therefore O
important O
in O
characterizing O
iron O
overload O
in O
Africa O
. O

First O
, O
the O
hepatic O
iron O
concentrations O
associated O
with O
African O
iron O
overload O
often O
far O
exceed O
those O
seen O
in O
alcoholic O
liver O
disease O
and O
histologic O
changes O
of O
alcohol O
effect O
are O
almost O
always O
absent O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
pattern O
of O
iron O
accumulation O
in O
African O
dietary O
iron O
is O
prominent O
in O
both O
macrophages O
and O
hepatic O
parenchymal O
cells O
; O
this O
pattern O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
HFE O
homochromatosis O
, O
which O
is O
marked O
by O
predominantly O
parenchymal O
iron O
- O
loading O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
African O
iron O
overload O
was O
purely O
dietary O
in O
nature O
, O
that O
increased O
iron O
and O
alcohol O
in O
the O
diet O
could O
fully O
explain O
markedly O
elevated O
tissue O
iron O
levels O
sometimes O
seen O
with O
this O
condition O
. O

Recent O
studies O
of O
pedigrees O
suggest O
that O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
high O
dietary O
iron O
content O
, O
a O
genetic O
defect O
may O
also O
be O
implicated O
in O
iron O
overload O
in O
Africans O
. O

These O
studies O
indicate O
that O
the O
possible O
defect O
is O
different O
from O
mutations O
in O
the O
HFE O
gene O
frequently O
found O
in O
Caucasians O
with O
iron O
overload O
, O
but O
the O
putative O
gene O
has O
not O
been O
identified O
. O

Recent O
studies O
also O
indicate O
that O
non O
- O
HFE O
iron O
overload O
occurs O
in O
African O
- O
Americans O
, O
but O
the O
prevalence O
and O
possible O
genetic O
basis O
is O
yet O
to O
be O
determined O
