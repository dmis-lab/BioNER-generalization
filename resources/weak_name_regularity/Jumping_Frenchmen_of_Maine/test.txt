. O

The O
" O
Jumping O
Frenchmen O
of O
Maine O
" O
were O
described O
by O
George O
Beard O
in O
1878 O
. O

They O
had O
an O
excessive O
startle O
response O
, O
sometimes O
with O
echolalia O
, O
echopraxia O
, O
or O
forced O
obedience O
. O

In O
1885 O
, O
Gilles O
de O
la O
Tourette O
concluded O
that O
" O
jumping O
" O
was O
similar O
to O
the O
syndrome O
that O
now O
bears O
his O
name O
. O

Direct O
observations O
of O
jumpers O
have O
been O
scarce O
. O

We O
studied O
eight O
jumpers O
from O
the O
Because O
region O
of O
Quebec O
. O

In O
our O
opinion O
, O
this O
phenomenon O
is O
not O
a O
neurologic O
disease O
, O
but O
can O
be O
explained O
in O
psychological O
terms O
as O
operant O
conditioned O
behavior O
. O

Our O
cases O
were O
related O
to O
specific O
conditions O
in O
lumber O
camps O
in O
the O
19th O
and O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
. O

Startle O
syndromes O
. O

Startle O
refers O
to O
a O
sudden O
involuntary O
movement O
of O
the O
body O
in O
response O
to O
a O
surprising O
and O
unexpected O
stimulus O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fast O
twitch O
of O
facial O
and O
body O
muscles O
evoked O
by O
a O
sudden O
and O
intense O
tactile O
, O
visual O
, O
or O
acoustic O
stimulus O
. O

While O
startle O
can O
be O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
protective O
function O
against O
injury O
, O
startle O
syndromes O
are O
abnormal O
responses O
to O
startling O
events O
, O
consisting O
of O
three O
heterogeneous O
groups O
of O
disorders O
. O

The O
first O
is O
hyperekplexia O
, O
characterized O
by O
brisk O
and O
generalized O
startle O
in O
response O
to O
trivial O
stimulation O
. O

The O
major O
form O
of O
hereditary O
hyperekplexia O
has O
a O
genetic O
basis O
, O
frequently O
due O
to O
mutations O
in O
the O
α O
1 O
subunit O
of O
the O
glycine O
receptor O
( O
GLRA1 O
) O
on O
chromosome O
5q O
. O

In O
the O
second O
group O
, O
normal O
startle O
induces O
complex O
but O
stereotyped O
motor O
and O
/ O
or O
behavioral O
abnormalities O
lasting O
several O
seconds O
, O
termed O
as O
startle O
epilepsy O
. O

It O
usually O
occurs O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
severe O
brain O
damage O
, O
particularly O
perinatal O
hypoxia O
. O

The O
third O
group O
is O
characterized O
by O
nonhabituating O
hyperstartling O
, O
provoked O
by O
loud O
noises O
, O
sudden O
commands O
, O
or O
gestures O
. O

The O
intensity O
of O
startle O
response O
tends O
to O
increase O
with O
frequency O
of O
stimulation O
, O
which O
often O
leads O
to O
injury O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
its O
occurrence O
is O
restricted O
to O
certain O
social O
or O
ethnic O
groups O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
, O
such O
as O
jumping O
Frenchmen O
of O
Maine O
among O
Franco O
- O
Canadian O
lumberjack O
communities O
, O
and O
Latah O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
. O

So O
far O
, O
no O
neurological O
abnormalities O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
association O
with O
these O
neuropsychiatric O
startle O
syndromes O
. O

In O
this O
chapter O
, O
the O
authors O
discuss O
the O
clinical O
presentation O
, O
physiology O
, O
and O
the O
neuronal O
basis O
of O
the O
normal O
human O
startle O
as O
well O
as O
different O
groups O
of O
abnormal O
startle O
syndromes O
. O

The O
aim O
is O
to O
provide O
an O
overview O
of O
hyperstartling O
with O
some O
diagnostic O
hints O
and O
the O
distinguishing O
features O
among O
these O
syndromes O
. O

From O
the O
jumping O
Frenchmen O
of O
Maine O
to O
post O
- O
traumatic O
stress O
disorder O
: O
the O
startle O
response O
in O
neuropsychiatry O
. O

The O
startle O
response O
is O
a O
universal O
and O
phylogenetically O
ancient O
reflex O
. O

Pathological O
exaggerations O
and O
modifications O
of O
startle O
underlie O
the O
symptomatology O
of O
a O
surprisingly O
diverse O
range O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
disorders O
, O
a O
fact O
that O
seems O
to O
have O
gone O
largely O
unappreciated O
. O

We O
review O
the O
available O
literature O
on O
the O
physiology O
of O
the O
normal O
human O
startle O
response O
and O
examine O
the O
neuropsychiatric O
conditions O
characterized O
by O
pathological O
startle O
. O

Startle O
epilepsy O
and O
primary O
hyperekplexia O
are O
considered O
as O
neurological O
disorders O
involving O
abnormal O
startle O
. O

Patients O
with O
hyperstartle O
and O
exotic O
culture O
- O
bound O
syndromes O
characterized O
by O
excessive O
startle O
are O
considered O
by O
the O
authors O
to O
represent O
extreme O
variants O
of O
the O
normal O
startle O
response O
. O

Post O
- O
traumatic O
stress O
disorder O
, O
drug O
and O
alcohol O
withdrawal O
states O
and O
schizophrenia O
all O
have O
abnormal O
startle O
as O
a O
clinical O
feature O
secondary O
to O
increased O
arousal O
and O
presumed O
disturbance O
of O
central O
neurotransmitter O
systems O
. O

The O
neurophysiological O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
abnormalities O
of O
the O
startle O
response O
may O
occur O
are O
discussed O
and O
a O
system O
of O
classification O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
hyperstartles O
is O
suggested O
. O

the O

has O
been O
used O
to O
describe O
both O

that O

Hemiballismus O

The O
relationship O
between O
a O
lesion O
of O
the O
subthalamic O
nucleus O
of O
Luys O
and O
contralateral O
hemiballismus O
was O
first O
convincingly O
demonstrated O
by O
Martin O
in O
1927 O
; O
this O
led O
20 O
years O
later O
to O
development O
of O
an O
animal O
model O
by O
Whittier O
and O
Mettler O
, O
who O
produced O
experimental O
hemichorea O
- O
hemiballismus O
in O
monkeys O
by O
lesioning O
the O

Since O
the O
late O
1980s O
, O
the O
neurochemistry O
and O
neurophysiology O
of O
the O
subthalamic O
nucleus O
have O
been O
substantially O
revised O
with O
the O
demonstration O
that O
the O
subthalamic O
nucleus O
is O
not O
fundamentally O
inhibitory O
but O
instead O
provides O
excitatory O
glutaminergic O
inputs O
to O
the O

, O
and O
appreciation O
that O
the O
subthalamic O
nucleus O
serves O
an O
important O
role O
in O
both O
hyperkinetic O
and O
hypokinetic O
movement O
disorders O
. O

Dystonia O
: O
Dystonias O
were O
often O
interpreted O
in O
psychological O
or O
psychiatric O
terms O
since O
the O
original O
descriptions O
of O
generalized O

Schwalbe O
( O

and O
Oppenheim O
( O

) O
. O

Although O
Oppenheim O
had O
first O
insisted O
that O
dystonia O
was O
an O
organic O
disease O
, O
it O
was O
only O
in O
the O
late O

20th O
century O
that O
an O
organic O
framework O
was O
firmly O
established O
with O
the O
identification O
of O
genetic O
mutations O
in O
some O
families O
with O
dystonia O
and O
with O
the O
demonstration O
that O
the O

were O
also O
recognized O

was O
clearly O
described O

and O
increasingly O
recognized O
in O
the O

Gilles O

Tourette O
and O
Charcot O
initially O
considered O
tic O
disorders O
and O
startle O
syndromes O
to O
be O
similar O
if O
not O
identical O
, O
but O
these O
disorders O
were O
later O
recognized O
as O
distinct O
. O

Psychodynamic O
and O
psychological O
theories O
or O

gave O
way O
in O
the O
1960s O
to O
biological O
theories O
supporting O
an O
important O
role O
for O
dopamine O
in O

, O
particularly O
with O
the O
discovery O
that O

in O

In O
the O
last O
two O
centuries O
, O
neuroscientists O

contributed O
greatly O
to O
our O
