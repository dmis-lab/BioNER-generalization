A O

We O

that O
are O

We O

As O
judged O

Therefore O
, O
we O
wanted O
to O
detect O

at O
an O

stage O
and O
investigate O
the O
strategy O

Despite O

more O
than O

In O

was O
observed O

No O

Massive O

either O

Neither O

Therefore O
, O
at O

the O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
Klinefelter O

seems O
to O
be O
made O
earlier O
nowadays O
probably O
because O

are O
more O

that O

at O

The O

that O

Because O

we O
examined O

Two O

a O

The O

was O
both O

but O
we O
could O
find O

only O

Since O

refused O

we O
can O
only O

if O
we O

From O
our O

we O
conclude O
that O
for O

, O
it O
is O
safer O
to O

We O
would O

The O
Robertsonian O

are O
due O
to O
the O

Finally O

both O

this O

led O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
that O

have O
an O
increased O
rate O

Furthermore O
the O
suggestion O
has O
frequently O

made O
that O
a O

is O
associated O
with O
an O

We O
have O
tested O
these O

hypotheses O
by O
examining O
the O

of O
a O

. O

In O
the O

the O

origin O

The O
cells O
were O
cultured O
under O
conditions O

for O

the O

and O
100 O
cells O
were O

No O

there O
was O
no O

Therefore O

our O

Klinefelter O
' O
s O
syndrome O
is O
generally O
characterized O
by O
hypergonadotrophic O
hypogonadism O
and O
azoospermia O
. O

The O
clinical O
features O
, O
however O
, O
are O
variable O
, O
and O
occasionally O
severe O
oligozoospermia O
may O
be O
present O
. O

Usually O
in O
these O
cases O
a O
46 O
, O
XY O
/ O
47 O
, O
XXY O
mosaic O
karyotype O
is O
involved O
. O

However O
, O
focal O
spermatogenesis O
and O
severe O
oligozoospermia O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
47 O
, O
XXY O
individuals O
too O
. O

In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
investigated O
whether O
testicular O
spermatozoa O
can O
be O
recovered O
in O
47 O
, O
XXY O
patients O
with O
a O
view O
to O
intracytoplasmic O
sperm O
injection O
( O
ICSI O
) O
. O

In O
four O
out O
of O
nine O
apparently O
non O
- O
mosaic O
47 O
, O
XXY O
patients O
, O
spermatozoa O
were O
recovered O
from O
the O
wet O
preparations O
of O
testicular O
tissue O
and O
ICSI O
was O
performed O
in O
three O
couples O
. O

In O
one O
patient O
in O
whom O
spermatozoa O
were O
successfully O
recovered O
and O
used O
for O
ICSI O
, O
no O
spermatozoa O
were O
retrieved O
at O
a O
second O
trial O
. O

Although O
these O
results O
show O
that O
in O
some O
47 O
, O
XXY O
individuals O
testicular O
spermatozoa O
can O
be O
successfully O
recovered O
and O
even O
used O
for O
ICSI O
, O
at O
present O
this O
approach O
should O
be O
considered O
experimental O
. O

There O
may O
indeed O
be O
some O
concern O
about O
the O
chromosomal O
normality O
of O
the O
embryos O
generated O
through O
this O
infertility O
treatment O
. O

Patients O
with O
Klinefelter O
' O

syndrome O
should O
therefore O
be O
counselled O
about O
the O
complexity O
of O
this O
treatment O
, O
which O
involves O
multiple O
testicular O
biopsies O
from O

we O
detected O

in O
3 O

The O
most O
striking O
finding O
was O
the O
relatively O
low O
percentage O
of O
spermatozoa O
in O
these O

, O
with O
an O
average O
of O
65 O

Apparently O
, O
in O
XYY O

, O
these O
IGC O

shed O

an O

The O

the O

AMH O

We O

We O
hypothesize O
that O

In O
the O
past O
10 O
years O
, O
our O
knowledge O
about O
fertility O
chances O
of O
patients O
with O
Klinefelter O
syndrome O
( O
KS O
, O
47 O
, O

) O
has O
changed O
considerably O
, O
especially O
when O
regarding O
the O
possibility O
of O
IVF O

treatment O
( O
in O

fertilisation O
, O
intracytoplasmic O
sperm O

) O
with O
single O
testicular O
spermatozoa O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
take O
this O
knowledge O
into O
consideration O
when O
counselling O
Klinefelter O
patients O
. O
Germ O
cell O
degeneration O
in O
the O
testicles O
of O
Klinefelter O
patients O
due O
to O
their O
additional O
X O
chromosome O
is O
an O
important O
phenomenon O
in O
this O
disease O
which O
is O
not O
yet O
fully O
understood O
. O

When O
entering O
puberty O
, O
the O
testicular O
volume O
of O
KS O
patients O
increases O
for O
a O
short O
time O
with O
rising O
testosterone O
and O
inhibin O

levels O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

These O
decrease O
, O
however O
, O
and O
FSH O
increases O
during O
puberty O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
indicate O
a O
critical O
point O
in O
time O
when O
spermatogenetic O
function O
of O
the O
testicles O
could O
still O
be O
existent O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
early O
puberty O
there O
could O
possibly O
be O
a O
time O
slot O
when O
spermatozoa O
could O
be O
detected O
in O
the O
ejaculate O
or O
- O
if O
not O
- O
at O

in O
the O
testicular O
tissue O
. O

These O
could O
be O
extracted O
by O

cryopreserved O

used O
for O

One O

Until O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
Klinefelter O
syndrome O
with O
a O
homogenous O
47 O
, O
XXY O
karyotype O
was O
considered O
a O
model O
of O
absolute O
male O

. O

We O
will O
discuss O
first O
the O
potential O

following O
Testicular O

, O
then O
the O
physiopathology O
of O
spermatogenic O
failure O
and O
the O
origin O
of O
focal O
spermatogenesis O
and O
risk O
of O
aneuploidy O
in O
offspring O
, O
and O
third O
the O
advantage O
of O
searching O
spermatozoa O
earlier O
instead O
of O
adult O
age O
. O

The O
rate O
of O
positive O
sperm O
extraction O
seems O
to O
be O
better O
for O
younger O
patients O
. O

During O
childhood O
, O
there O
is O
a O
low O
rate O
of O
spermatogonia O
. O

The O
spermagonia O
, O
which O
completes O
the O
spermatogenesis O
, O
seems O
resulting O
from O
a O
rare O
clone O
of O
46 O
, O
XY O
gonia O
, O
having O
lost O
their O
extra O
X O
chromosome O
. O

Several O
arguments O
suggest O
that O
this O
focal O
spermatogenesis O
decreases O
with O
age O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
androgen O
treatment O
, O
frequently O
prescribed O
in O
case O
of O
Klinefelter O

, O
carries O
a O
risk O
of O
decreasing O
focal O
spermatogenesis O
by O
lowering O
gonadotropins O
. O

The O
question O
arises O
if O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
expect O
the O
sperm O
cryopreservation O
before O
introducing O
androgen O
treatment O

Earlier O

the O
X O

The O
Y O
chromosome O
promotes O
the O
growth O
of O

, O
whereas O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
X O

seems O
to O
be O
restricted O
mainly O
on O
enamel O
formation O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
are O
evidences O
that O
both O

, O
which O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
increased O
enamel O

, O
the O

There O
is O
some O
evidence O

Mechanisms O

A O
reduction O

associated O
with O
an O

frequency O

Similarly O
, O
individuals O
with O

also O
have O
a O
paucity O

the O

undergone O

Meiotic O
studies O
using O

demonstrated O
errors O
of O
chromosome O

and O
significantly O
reduced O
recombination O
in O
infertile O
men O

These O

an O
increased O
risk O
of O
aneuploidy O
in O

Thus O
, O
evidence O
is O
starting O
to O

that O

in O

Thus O

In O

( O

has O
moved O
to O

with O
its O
ability O
to O
rapidly O
characterize O
chromosome O

at O
resolutions O
much O
higher O
than O

However O
, O
array O
CGH O
, O
like O
all O

procedures O
, O
has O
heretofore O
been O
deemed O
unable O
to O
detect O
ploidy O
, O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
fetal O
demise O
and O
spontaneous O

. O

We O
recently O
developed O
a O
CGH O
microarray O
that O
is O
designed O
for O
detecting O
aneuploidy O
and O
unbalanced O
chromosome O
rearrangements O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
introduce O
the O
use O
of O
a O
Klinefelter O
male O
cell O
line O
( O
47 O
, O

) O
as O
a O
control O
for O
array O
CGH O
analyses O
on O
products O
of O
conception O
( O

) O
. O

This O
approach O
facilitates O
the O
detection O
of O
common O
trisomies O
and O
monosomies O
of O
the O
sex O
chromosomes O
by O
reducing O
the O
analysis O
to O
the O
identification O
of O

or O
losses O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
in O
a O
blinded O
study O
, O
careful O
interpretation O
of O
the O
microarray O
results O
with O
particular O
attention O
to O
the O
sex O
chromosome O
ratios O
between O
the O
patient O
sample O
and O
the O
control O
allowed O
for O
the O
detection O
of O
some O
common O
triploidies O
. O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
using O
a O
chromosomally O
abnormal O
cell O

in O
array O

can O
be O
applied O
to O
other O

that O

, O
when O
properly O
performed O

is O
a O

With O

the O

We O

that O

the O

the O

invasive O

still O

However O
, O
most O
of O

Non O

( O

as O

that O

therapy O
has O

shown O
some O
efficacy O

Graham O

recommend O

they O

stable O
childhood O
conditions O
. O

Though O
it O
is O
generally O
thought O
that O
androgens O
increase O
agressiveness O
, O
we O
found O
no O
consistent O
data O
in O

proving O
that O
the O
restoration O
of O
physiological O
androgen O

levels O
increases O
crimes O
nor O

. O

In O
the O
contrary O
, O
Miller O

described O
four O

up O
was O
available O
: O
their O
behavior O
seemed O

and O
none O
of O

recurred O

However O
, O
the O
initiation O
of O
androgen O
therapy O
for O
patients O
with O
severe O

illness O
should O
be O
done O
very O
carefully O

Conclusion O
- O
The O
Klinefelter O
' O
s O
syndrome O
is O
frequent O
and O
, O
if O
not O
diagnosed O
( O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
most O
common O
case O
) O
, O
these O
men O
have O
higher O
risks O
to O
develop O
psychiatric O
disorders O
. O

Therefore O
, O
child O
psychiatrists O
and O
psychiatrists O
should O
evoke O
that O
diagnosis O
when O
they O
examine O
boys O
or O
men O
who O
present O
typical O
physical O
traits O
of O
KS O
( O
tallness O
, O
underdevelopped O
testes O
) O
associated O
to O
school O
problems O
and O
/ O
or O
psychiatric O
disorders O
. O

Indeed O
, O
if O
the O
diagnosis O
is O
confirmed O
by O
an O
endocrinologist O
and O
a O
genetic O
testing O
, O
psychological O
follow O
- O
up O
and O
testosterone O
undecanoate O
treatment O
( O
in O
case O
of O
abnormal O
testosterone O
blood O
levels O
) O
should O
be O
initiated O
. O

This O
therapy O
generally O
improves O
physical O
well O
- O
being O
and O
improves O
mood O
, O
concentration O
, O
capacity O
at O

. O

There O
is O
no O
consistent O

that O
restoring O

would O
be O
dangerous O
for O

. O

However O
, O
this O
should O
be O

for O

Based O

we O

the O

The O
syndrome O

characterized O
by O
testicular O
destruction O

Klinefelter O
syndrome O
( O
KS O
) O
with O
the O
classic O
47 O
, O
XXY O
karyotype O
is O
the O
most O
frequent O
chromosomal O
aneuploidy O
, O
with O
a O
prevalence O

1 O
in O
700 O
men O
; O
although O
the O

clinical O
picture O
is O
well O
- O
known O
and O
easily O
recognizable O
, O
most O
patients O
remain O
undiagnosed O
. O

The O
rate O
of O

during O

is O
extremely O
low O

The O
low O
rate O
of O
timely O
diagnosis O
is O
because O
most O
of O
the O
classical O

of O
androgen O

appear O
in O
mid O

it O
is O
important O
to O

that O
adult O

may O
show O
a O
great O
variability O
in O
clinical O

A O
common O
, O
often O
underappreciated O
, O
element O
in O

is O
the O
characteristic O

whether O

Our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
KS O
can O
be O

that O

have O
also O
been O

this O

The O

a O
fertile O
ground O
for O
scientific O
investigation O
because O
of O
the O
homogeneity O

the O
increased O

However O
, O
the O
research O

of O

have O
been O
plagued O

a O
variety O

In O

of O
these O
shortcomings O
, O
there O
remains O
some O
consistency O
to O
the O
neurobehavioral O
profile O
of O
this O

. O

In O
general O
, O
the O
prenatal O
population O
of O
boys O

XXY O
is O
less O
affected O
developmentally O
and O
is O
more O
academically O
successful O
than O
the O
boys O
identified O
through O

diagnosis O
. O

Boys O
with O
XXY O
often O
have O
decreased O
muscle O

, O
delayed O
speech O
, O
and O

skills O
with O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O

. O

It O
does O
appear O
that O
social O
difficulties O
may O
be O
mediated O
by O

problems O
and O
temperamental O
issues O
. O

The O
neurobehavioral O

of O
boys O
with O
XXY O
places O
them O
at O
risk O
for O
school O
failure O
and O
secondary O
behavioral O
disturbances O
. O

Therefore O
, O
early O
evaluation O
and O
intervention O
is O
strongly O
recommended O
since O
the O
prognosis O
may O
be O

significantly O
with O

This O

The O
aim O
was O
to O
assess O
if O
these O

measured O
in O
saliva O
. O

Within O
the O
47 O
, O
XXY O
group O
lower O
levels O
of O
salivary O
testosterone O
were O
significantly O
associated O
with O
higher O
levels O

The O
correlation O
was O
strong O
, O

of O

. O

However O
, O
salivary O
levels O
of O
testosterone O
were O
uncorrelated O

. O

These O
findings O
point O
out O
that O
lower O
testosterone O
levels O
might O
contribute O
to O
high O
social O
anxiety O
in O
47 O
, O
XXY O
, O
suggesting O
that O
anxiety O
should O
be O
monitored O
in O
pubertal O
boys O
with O

presenting O

This O
should O
be O
done O
in O

In O
contrast O
, O

levels O
were O
not O
associated O

that O

Since O

the O

The O

We O
therefore O
investigated O

to O
determine O
whether O
the O

Our O

demonstrate O
that O
49 O

during O

, O
29 O
% O
during O
MII O
and O
16 O
% O
were O

; O
a O
further O
7 O
% O
were O
meiotic O
but O
could O
not O
be O
assigned O
as O
either O
MI O
or O
MII O
because O
of O
recombination O
at O
the O
centromere O
. O

Among O
the O
MI O
cases O
, O
a O
majority O
( O
56 O
% O
) O
had O
no O
detectable O
transitions O
and O
so O
absent O
recombination O
is O
an O
important O
factor O
for O
X O
chromosome O
non O
- O
disjunction O
. O

However O
, O
similar O
to O
trisomy O
15 O
and O
unlike O
trisomy O
21 O
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
mean O
maternal O
age O
of O
transitional O
MI O
errors O
compared O
with O
nullitransitional O
cases O
. O

In O
our O
studies O
of O
MII O
errors O
, O
recombination O
appeared O
normal O

there O
was O
no O

, O
surprisingly O
, O
the O

associated O

both O

He O
did O
not O

to O
both O
describe O
the O

Because O

Controls O

on O
the O

, O

The O
number O

in O

was O
not O
different O
from O
that O
of O
those O
with O

we O

These O
primary O
hypothesis O

that O

whether O

If O
it O
is O

that O
the O
majority O

a O
normal O

level O
, O
the O
identification O

the O
purpose O

are O
one O
of O
the O
more O
distinctive O
traits O

It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
limitations O
in O

markedly O
affect O
social O

behavioral O
aspects O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
development O

Moreover O
, O
difficulties O

Aneuploidy O

We O

Analysis O

Since O

have O
demonstrated O
that O

It O
has O
generally O

thought O
that O
the O
germ O

are O
unable O
to O
proceed O

Any O
spermatozoa O
produced O
have O
been O
assumed O
to O
come O
from O
a O

and O
therefore O
likely O
to O
have O
a O
normal O

However O
, O
recent O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
meiosis O

may O
be O
possible O

Whether O

arise O

or O
from O

which O
have O
attained O
a O

is O

Any O
risks O
in O

Therefore O
, O
the O

Although O

that O
the O

males O
leading O
to O
a O
karyotype O

It O
is O
associated O

It O
is O

that O
the O

The O

how O

It O
has O

The O
importance O

has O
increased O

Klinefelter O
syndrome O
( O

is O
the O
most O
frequent O
sex O
chromosomal O
aneuploidy O
. O

The O
karyotype O

, O
XXY O
originates O
from O
either O
paternal O
or O
maternal O
meiotic O
nondisjunction O
during O

KS O

are O
very O

exhibit O
marked O
gonadal O

, O
presenting O
both O
in O
severely O

In O

, O
neurocognitive O

, O
as O
well O
as O
cardiovascular O
, O
metabolic O
and O
bone O
disorders O
are O
often O
found O
in O
KS O
and O
might O
explain O
for O
an O
increased O
morbidity O

mortality O
. O

All O
conditions O
in O
KS O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
induced O
by O
both O
gene O
overdosage O

resulting O
from O
supernumerary O

Notwithstanding O
, O
the O
clinical O
features O
are O
highly O

between O
KS O
men O
. O

Symptoms O
can O
become O
obvious O
at O
infancy O

childhood O
, O
or O
adolescence O
. O

However O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
KS O
subjects O
is O
diagnosed O
during O

. O

KS O
adolescents O
require O
specific O
attention O
regarding O
pubertal O
development O
, O
in O
order O
to O
exploit O
their O
remaining O
fertility O
potential O
and O
allow O
for O

The O
chances O

decline O
with O

demonstrates O
that O
the O
