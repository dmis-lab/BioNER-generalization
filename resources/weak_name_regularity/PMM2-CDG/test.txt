The O
first O
patient O
was O

a O

at O
two O
years O

not O

any O

The O
swelling O
increased O
in O

over O

At O
12 O
years O
, O
lymphoscintigraphy O
revealed O
decreased O
lymphatic O
draining O
in O
both O
legs O
, O
which O
was O
more O
profound O
in O
the O
right O
leg O
. O

The O
second O
patient O
was O
treated O
for O
pulmonary O

at O
age O
2 O
months O
. O

Postoperative O
, O
the O
patient O
suffered O
from O

, O
recurrent O

the O

who O
showed O

profound O

of O
the O

this O

We O
found O
