To O

the O
etiology O

remains O
a O
mystery O

Interestingly O
, O
clues O
as O
to O
the O
origin O
of O
this O
collection O
of O

may O
reside O
in O
an O
old O
hypothesis O
concerning O
the O
midline O
as O
a O
developmental O
field O
as O
postulated O
by O
Dr O
. O

John O
Opitz O
. O

This O
theory O
suggested O
that O
the O
midline O
was O
not O
a O
separate O
entity O
, O
but O
could O
be O
influenced O
by O
other O
developmental O
signals O
. O

With O
new O
information O
concerning O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
left O
- O
right O
axis O
( O
laterality O
) O
and O
the O
importance O
of O
communications O
between O
this O
axis O
and O
the O
cranio O
- O
caudal O
( O
anterior O
- O
posterior O
) O
axis O
for O
normal O
development O
, O
it O
has O
become O
clear O
that O
coordination O
of O
the O
molecular O
signals O
responsible O
for O
specification O
of O
these O
domains O
is O
essential O
for O
normal O
development O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
if O
the O
signals O
regulating O
laterality O
are O
disrupted O
, O
then O
midline O
and O
other O
defects O
can O
occur O
as O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
cases O
of O
heterotaxy O
, O
presumably O
because O
of O
a O
disruption O
in O
this O
coordinated O
signaling O
effort O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
origins O
of O
the O
defects O
commonly O
observed O
in O
the O
VACTERL O
association O
may O
be O
due O
to O
altered O

with O
4 O
or O
more O
of O
these O

were O
compared O
with O
41 O
previously O

. O

There O
was O
good O
agreement O
with O
reference O
to O
the O
frequency O
of O
the O
major O
malformations O
noted O
in O
the O
VACTERL O

. O

While O
anal O
atresia O
was O
not O
so O
common O
in O
our O
patients O
, O
cardiac O
anomalies O
and O
radial O
limb O

occurred O
somewhat O
more O
frequently O
. O

In O

with O
previous O
findings O
we O
also O
emphasize O
a O
single O
umbilical O

as O
one O
of O
the O
malformations O
in O
the O
spectrum O
of O
the O
VACTERL O

( O

. O

Because O
of O
the O
high O
incidence O
of O
rib O
anomalies O
in O
our O
patients O
and O
in O
earlier O
cases O
with O
complete O
medical O
records O
it O
is O
suggested O
that O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
VACTERL O
association O
should O
be O
enlarged O
by O
this O
malformation O
. O

Thus O
the O
R O
in O
VACTERL O
would O
stand O
not O
only O
for O
renal O

but O
als O
for O
rib O

. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
spectrum O

could O
be O
extended O
by O
auricular O
defects O
( O
A O

atresia O

. O

When O

attention O
should O
be O
drawn O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O

. O

The O
developmentally O

are O
generally O

At O

The O
striking O
feature O
was O
the O
simultaneous O
occurrence O
of O
two O
rare O
limb O

of O
right O
upper O
and O
lower O
limb O
in O
the O

who O
also O
had O

. O

These O
limb O
defects O
were O
- O
meromelia O
of O
the O
right O
upper O
limb O
( O
due O
to O

of O

, O

a O

due O
to O
co O

existence O
of O

hemimelia O
. O

We O
could O
not O
trace O
the O
co O

with O

in O
the O
existing O

as O
was O
observed O
by O

. O

The O
simultaneous O
occurrence O
of O
the O

involving O

anatomic O
sites O
supports O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
' O
axial O

in O

rather O
than O
' O

, O
as O
is O
popularly O
held O
in O
patients O
with O

( O
ARM O

. O

Further O
, O
it O
points O
to O
occurrence O
of O
an O
early O
embryonic O
insult O
, O
probably O
taking O
place O
at O
blastogenic O
stage O
, O
when O

Cluster O
analysis O
of O
the O

in O
86 O

identified O
four O

Anomalies O
in O
the O

were O

In O
the O

the O

Each O
of O
these O

Shh O

confirming O
that O
Shh O
is O
active O
during O
the O
process O
of O

Relative O

The O

that O

The O

The O
VACTERL O

defined O
as O
the O
nonrandom O

of O

The O
current O
communication O
presents O
an O
argument O
that O
patients O

should O
be O
classified O
into O
three O
district O
groups O
based O
on O
their O
limb O

: O
VACTERL1 O
: O
patients O

; O
VACTERL2 O
: O
patients O
with O
limb O
anomalies O
other O
than O
radial O

defects O
of O
the O
upper O
limbs O
; O
and O
VACTERL3 O
: O
patients O
with O
radial O
ray O
defects O
of O
the O
upper O
limbs O
. O

The O
author O
will O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
rationale O
behind O
the O
L1 O
- O
3 O
classification O
in O
patients O
in O
VA O
is O
based O
on O
the O
embryogenesis O
of O
the O
6 O
affected O
anatomical O
areas O
in O
VA O
. O

The O
pathogenesis O
of O
VACTERL1 O
is O
secondary O
to O
perturbations O
of O
Sonic O
Hedgehog O
( O
SHH O
) O
interactions O
. O

SHH O
signaling O
is O
known O
to O
have O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
normal O
development O
of O
the O
vertebrae O
, O
ano O
- O
rectal O
area O
, O
heart O
, O
tracheo O
- O
esophageal O
area O
, O
and O
kidney O
. O

However O
, O
SHH O
is O
not O
involved O
in O
the O
development O
of O
the O
radial O
ray O
; O
hence O
, O
patients O
present O
with O
no O
limb O
defects O
. O

The O
pathogenesis O
of O
VACTERL2 O
is O
variable O
depending O
on O
the O
type O
of O
gene O
mutation O
. O

The O
pathogenesis O
of O
VACTERL3 O
is O
related O
to O
errors O
in O
a O
group O
of O
proteins O
( O
namely O
, O
the O
proteins O
of O
the O
TBX5 O
- O
SALL4 O
- O
SALL1 O
loop O
and O
the O
FGF8 O
- O
FGF10 O
loop O
/ O
pathway O
) O
. O

These O
proteins O
are O
essential O
for O
the O
normal O
development O
of O
the O
radial O
ray O
and O
they O
interact O
in O
the O
development O
of O
the O
other O
anatomical O
areas O
of O
VA O
including O
the O
heart O
and O
