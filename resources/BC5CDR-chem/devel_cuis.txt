against -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Paracetamol D000082

did -
not -
affect -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Altered -

The -

involved -
in -
the -
pathophysiology -

The -
symptoms -
of -

are -
similar -
to -
those -
of -

Therefore -
, -
we -
conducted -
an -

The -
age -

did -
not -
differ -
from -

RESULTS -
: -

In -
the -

we -
detected -
an -

Herein -
, -
we -
report -
that -
multiple -
( -

injections -
of -
METH D008694
significantly -
increased -

This -
increase -

was -
not -
secondary -

revealed -
differential -
changes -
in -
MAP -

MEK1 -
was -
significantly -
decreased -
also -
after -
a -
single -
injection -
of -
METH D008694
, -
but -
to -
a -
much -
lesser -
degree -
than -
after -
multiple -

that -
alterations -
in -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Doxorubicin D004317
induces -
a -

perpetuating -
nephropathy -
characterized -
by -
early -
glomerular -
and -
late -

. -

We -
investigated -
the -
potential -
role -
of -
mitochondrial -
injury -
in -
the -
onset -
of -
these -
lesions -
. -

METHODS -
: -
Rats -
were -
treated -
with -
intravenous -
doxorubicin D004317
( -
1 -
mg -

) -
for -
7 -
weeks -
and -
were -
sacrificed -
either -
1 -

) -
or -
30 -
weeks -
( -
' -
long -

' -
) -
following -
the -
last -
dose -
. -

Additional -
rats -
received -
a -
single -
dose -
either -
6 -
days -
or -
2 -
h -
prior -
to -
euthanasia -
. -

All -
rats -
were -
killed -
at -
48 -
weeks -
of -
age -
. -

Glomerular -
and -
tubular -
injury -
was -
monitored -
and -
correlated -
to -
the -
activity -
or -
expression -
of -
respiratory -
chain -
components -
. -

Finally -
, -
we -
quantified -
both -
nuclear -
and -
mitochondrial -
DNA -
( -
mtDNA -
) -
as -
well -
as -
superoxide D013481

RESULTS -
: -
The -
' -
long -
- -
term -
' -
group -
had -
significant -
glomerular -
and -
tubular -
lesions -
, -
depressed -
activities -
of -
mtDNA -
- -
encoded -

In -
addition -
, -
expression -
of -
the -
mtDNA -
- -
encoded -
COX -
subunit -
I -
was -
reduced -
and -
mtDNA -
levels -
were -
decreased -
. -

In -
' -
short -
- -
term -
' -
rats -
, -
there -
were -
fewer -
tubular -
lesions -
, -
but -
similar -
numbers -
of -
glomerular -
lesions -
activity -
. -

Among -
all -
animals -
, -
glomerular -
and -
tubular -
injury -
were -
inversely -
correlated -
with -
mtDNA -
levels -
, -
mtDNA -
- -
encoded -

activities -
and -
with -
the -
expression -
of -
the -
mtDNA -
- -
encoded -
respiratory -
chain -
subunit -
COX -
- -
I -
. -

Injury -
was -
positively -
correlated -
with -
superoxide D013481
production -
and -
the -
activities -
of -
nucleus -
- -
encoded -
mitochondrial -
or -

Kidneys -
from -
the -
' -

term -
' -
group -
showed -
more -
mtDNA -

' -
animals -
and -
these -
were -
not -
observed -
in -
the -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
These -
results -
suggest -
an -
important -
role -
for -
quantitative -
and -
qualitative -
mtDNA -
alterations -
through -

SUMMARY -
: -
A -
46 -

American -
man -
experienced -

B -
, -
then -
petit -
mal -
seizures -
as -
the -
infusion -
was -
stopped -
and -
the -
drug -
concentrations -
decreased -
with -
time -
. -

The -
patients -
concurrent -
medications -
included -
didanosine D016049
, -
hydroxyzine D006919
, -
promethazine D011398
, -
hydrocortisone D006854
, -
and -
prochlorperazine D011346
. -

Despite -
administration -
of -
phenytoin D010672
and -
lorazepam D008140
, -
the -
seizures -
persisted -
and -
occurred -
only -
during -
amphotercin D000666
B -
administration -
. -

DISCUSSION -
: -
AIDS -
and -
cryptococcal -
meningitis -
, -
both -
of -
which -
the -
patient -
had -
, -
can -
potentially -
cause -
seizures -
. -

The -
patient -
had -
a -
history -
of -
alcohol -
abuse -
; -
alcohol D000431
intake -
as -
well -
as -
withdrawal -
can -
also -
cause -
seizures -
. -

Didanosine D016049
also -
has -
a -
potential -
for -
inducing -
seizures -
. -

However -
, -
these -
other -
potential -
causes -
of -
seizure -
were -
ruled -
out -
. -

The -
time -
course -
of -
events -
suggested -
that -
amphotericin D000666
B -
was -
the -
cause -
of -
the -
seizures -
in -
this -
AIDS -
patient -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Amphotericin D000666
B -
seems -
to -
be -
the -
probable -
cause -
of -
the -
seizures -
. -

To -
date -
, -
only -
three -
cases -
of -
seizures -
associated -
with -
amphotericin D000666
B -
have -
been -
reported -

should -
be -
aware -

It -
has -

was -
to -
determine -
whether -
myocardial -

Thus -

bupropion D016642
as -
an -
aid -
for -
smoking -

10 -
weeks -
prior -

. -

He -
developed -
acute -
liver -
failure -
with -
rapid -
deterioration -
of -
renal -
function -
. -

Liver -
biopsy -
showed -
evidence -
of -

injury -
. -

His -
condition -
was -
further -
complicated -
by -
sepsis -
and -
coagulopathy -
. -

Death -
resulted -
19 -
days -
after -
the -
onset -
of -
symptoms -
. -

The -
likelihood -
that -
bupropion D016642
induced -
hepatotoxicity -
in -

patient -
was -
possible -
, -
based -
on -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Although -
there -
is -
increasing -
evidence -
of -
hepatotoxicity -
induced -
by -
bupropion D016642
, -
this -
is -
the -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Pemoline D010389
is -
an -
oxazolidine C064210
derivative -
that -
is -
structurally -
different -
from -
amphetamines D000662
and -
used -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
attention -
deficit -
disorder -
. -

Pemoline D010389
has -
not -
been -
commonly -
associated -
in -
the -
literature -
as -
a -
cause -
of -
acute -
movement -
disorders -
. -

The -
following -
case -
describes -
two -
children -
acutely -
poisoned -
with -
pemoline D010389
who -
experienced -
profound -
choreoathetosis -
. -

CASE -
REPORT -
: -
Two -
, -
3 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
male -
, -
identical -
twin -
siblings -
presented -
to -
the -
emergency -
department -
after -
found -
playing -
with -
a -
an -
empty -
bottle -
of -
pemoline D010389
originally -
containing -
59 -
tablets -
. -

The -
children -
had -
a -
medical -
history -
significant -
for -
attention -
deficit -
disorder -
previously -
treated -
with -
methylphenidate D008774
without -
success -
. -

This -
was -
their -
first -
day -
of -
pemoline D010389
therapy -
. -

The -
choreoathetoid -
movements -
began -
45 -
min -
to -
1 -
h -
after -
ingestion -
. -

The -
children -
gave -
no -
history -
of -
prior -
movement -
disorders -
and -
there -
was -
no -
family -
history -
of -
movement -
disorders -
. -

The -
children -
received -
gastrointestinal -
decontamination -
and -
high -
doses -
of -
intravenous -
benzodiazepines D001569
in -
an -
attempt -
to -
control -
the -
choreoathetoid -
movements -
. -

Despite -
treatment -
, -
the -
children -
continued -
to -
have -
choreoathetosis -
for -
approximately -
24 -
hours -
. -

Forty -
- -
eight -
hours -
after -
admission -
, -
the -
children -
appeared -
to -
be -
at -
their -
baseline -
and -
were -
discharged -
home -
. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Pemoline D010389
associated -
movement -
disorder -
has -
been -
rarely -
reported -
in -
the -
acute -
toxicology -
literature -
. -

The -
possibility -
of -
choreoathetoid -
movements -
should -
be -
considered -
in -
patients -
presenting -
after -
pemoline D010389
overdose -

Continuous -

administration -
of -
mesna D015080
to -
prevent -
ifosfamide D007069
- -
induced -
hemorrhagic -
cystitis -
. -

Hemorrhagic -
cystitis -
is -
a -
major -
potential -
toxicity -
of -
ifosfamide D007069
that -
can -
be -
prevented -
by -
administering -
mesna D015080
along -
with -
the -
cytotoxic -
agent -
. -

Mesna D015080
is -
generally -
administered -
by -
the -
intravenous -
route -
, -
although -
experience -
with -
oral -
delivery -
of -
the -
drug -
has -
increased -
. -

The -
continuous -
subcutaneous -
administration -
of -
mesna D015080
has -
the -
advantage -
of -
not -
requiring -
intravenous -
access -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
subcutaneous -
delivery -
of -
the -
neutralizing -
agent -
will -
not -
be -
associated -
with -
the -
risk -
of -
inadequate -
urinary -
mesna D015080
concentrations -
, -
such -
as -
in -
a -
patient -
taking -
oral -
mesna D015080
who -
experiences -
severe -
ifosfamide D007069
- -
induced -
emesis -
and -
is -
unable -
to -
absorb -
the -
drug -
. -

Limited -
clinical -
experience -
with -
continuous -
subcutaneous -
mesna D015080
administration -
suggests -
it -
is -
a -
safe -
, -
practical -
, -
and -
economic -
method -
of -
drug -
delivery -
that -
permits -
ifosfamide D007069
to -
be -
administered -
successfully -
in -
the -
outpatient -
setting -

similarly -
increased -
muscular -
incoordination -
by -
diazepam D003975
, -
but -
NH4Ac C018824
treatment -
alone -
had -
no -
effect -
. -

Thus -
, -
hyperammonemia -
is -
capable -
of -
altering -
drug -
action -
and -
must -
be -
considered -
along -
with -
impaired -
drug -
metabolism -
in -
enhanced -
drug -
responses -
associated -
with -

Experiments -

Addition -

tissues -
, -
but -
calcium D002118
- -
independent -
catecholamine D002395
release -
by -
acetaldehyde D000079
was -
not -
blocked -
by -
NH4Ac C018824
. -

These -
results -
suggested -
that -

the -
actions -
of -
NH4Ac C018824
and -
the -
calcium D002118

The -
data -
suggest -
that -
hyperammonemia -
exerts -
a -
calcium D002118
channel -
blocking -
action -
which -
enhances -
the -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -

has -
been -

to -

Characterization -
of -
two -

clinical -
syndromes -

A -
patient -
with -
sinus -
bradycardia -
and -
atrioventricular -
block -
, -
induced -
by -
carbamazepine D002220
, -
prompted -
an -
extensive -
literature -
review -
of -
all -
previously -
reported -
cases -
. -

From -
the -
analysis -
of -
these -
cases -
, -
two -
distinct -
forms -
of -
carbamazepine D002220
- -
associated -
cardiac -
dysfunction -
emerged -
. -

One -
patient -
group -
developed -
sinus -
tachycardias -
in -
the -
setting -
of -
a -
massive -
carbamazepine D002220
overdose -
. -

The -
second -
group -
consisted -
almost -
exclusively -
of -
elderly -
women -
who -
developed -
potentially -
life -
- -
threatening -
bradyarrhythmias -

atrioventricular -
conduction -
delay -
, -
associated -
with -
either -
therapeutic -
or -
modestly -
elevated -
carbamazepine D002220
serum -
levels -
. -

Because -
carbamazepine D002220
is -
widely -
used -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
many -
neurologic -
and -
psychiatric -
conditions -
, -
the -
recognition -
of -
the -
latter -
syndrome -
has -
important -
implications -
for -
the -
use -
of -
this -
drug -
in -
elderly -
patients -

The -
inferior -
colliculus -
( -
IC -
) -
is -
primarily -
involved -
in -
the -
processing -
of -
auditory -
information -
, -
but -
it -
is -
distinguished -
from -
other -
auditory -
nuclei -
in -
the -
brainstem -
by -
its -
connections -
with -
structures -
of -
the -
motor -
system -
. -

Functional -
evidence -
relating -
the -
IC -
to -
motor -
behavior -
derives -
from -
experiments -
showing -
that -
activation -
of -
the -

, -
the -
nature -
of -

is -
still -

Our -

that -

Diagnosis -

have -
been -
reported -

Migraine -
with -

have -
the -

pain -
phase -
, -
thus -
indicating -
that -
migraine -
with -

and -

share -
a -
common -
pathway -
of -
nociception -

In -
recent -
years -

increasing -
evidence -
has -
suggested -
that -
the -
messenger -

nitric D009569

( -

is -
involved -
in -

In -

to -

whether -
the -

is -
true -
for -

, -
in -
the -

The -
specific -
aim -
was -
to -
elucidate -
whether -
an -
aura -
and -

or -
an -

could -
be -

In -
the -

the -

headache -
gradually -
disappeared -
, -
whereas -
in -
migraineurs -
peak -
headache -
intensity -
occurred -
at -
a -
mean -
time -
of -
240 -
min -

infusion -
. -

At -
this -
time -
the -
induced -
headache -
in -
6 -
of -
12 -
migraineurs -
fulfilled -
the -
diagnostic -
criteria -
for -
migraine -
without -
aura -
of -
the -
International -
Headache -
Society -
. -

The -
results -
therefore -
suggest -
that -
NO D009569
is -
involved -
in -
the -
pain -
mechanisms -
of -
migraine -
with -

Since -

understanding -
of -
the -

Prevention -
Study -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Tamoxifen D013629
is -
a -
candidate -
chemopreventive -
agent -
in -
breast -
cancer -
, -
although -
the -
drug -
may -
be -
associated -
with -
the -
development -
of -
endometrial -
cancer -
. -

Therefore -
we -
did -
a -
trial -
in -
hysterectomised -
women -
of -
tamoxifen D013629
as -
a -
chemopreventive -
. -

METHODS -
: -
In -
October -
, -
1992 -
, -
we -
started -
a -
double -
- -
blind -
placebo -
- -
controlled -
, -
randomised -
trial -
of -
tamoxifen D013629
in -
women -
( -
mainly -
in -
Italy -
) -
who -
did -
not -
have -
breast -
cancer -
and -
who -
had -
had -
a -
hysterectomy -
. -

Women -
were -
randomised -
to -
receive -
tamoxifen D013629
20 -
mg -

or -
placebo -
, -
both -

In -
June -

1997 -
, -
the -
trialists -
and -
the -
data -
- -
monitoring -
committee -
decided -
to -
end -
recruitment -
primarily -
because -
of -
the -
number -
of -

dropping -
out -
of -
the -

Recruitment -
ended -

and -
the -

will -
continue -
as -
planned -

The -
primary -
endpoints -
are -
the -

There -
is -
a -

we -
found -
eight -

compared -
with -
one -
case -
among -
362 -
women -
allocated -
to -
tamoxifen D013629

The -
H2 -

ranitidine D011899

hypersecretion -
on -
a -
short -

in -
22 -

Nineteen -

had -
Zollinger -

Ellison -
syndrome -
, -
one -
patient -
had -
systemic -
mastocytosis -

and -
two -

The -
rates -
of -
onset -
of -
the -
action -
of -
cimetidine D002927
and -
ranitidine D011899
were -
the -
same -
. -

The -
actions -
of -
both -
drugs -
were -
increased -
by -
anticholinergic -
agents -
, -
and -
there -
was -
a -
close -
correlation -
between -
the -
daily -
maintenance -
dose -
of -
each -
drug -
needed -
to -
control -
acid -
secretion -
. -

However -
, -
ranitidine D011899
was -
threefold -
more -
potent -
than -
cimetidine D002927
both -
in -
acute -
inhibition -
studies -
and -
in -
the -
median -

. -

Sixty -
percent -
of -
the -
males -
developed -
breast -
changes -
or -
impotence -
while -
taking -
cimetidine D002927
and -
in -
all -
cases -
these -
changes -
disappeared -
when -
cimetidine D002927
was -
replaced -
by -
ranitidine D011899

Treatment -
with -
high -

of -
cimetidine D002927
( -
one -
to -
60 -
months -
; -

) -
or -
ranitidine D011899
( -
two -
to -
31 -
months -
; -
median -
, -
14 -
months -
) -
was -
not -
associated -
with -
hepatic -
or -
hematologic -
toxicity -
or -
alterations -
of -
serum -
gastrin -
concentrations -
, -
but -
ranitidine D011899
therapy -
was -
associated -
with -
a -
significantly -
lower -
serum -
creatinine D003404
level -
than -
seen -
with -
cimetidine D002927
therapy -
. -

The -
results -
show -
that -
both -
drugs -
can -
adequately -
inhibit -
acid -
secretion -
in -
patients -
with -
gastric -
hypersecretory -
states -
. -

Both -
are -
safe -
at -
high -
doses -
, -
but -
ranitidine D011899
is -
threefold -
more -
potent -
and -
does -
not -
cause -
the -
antiandrogen -
side -
effects -
frequently -
seen -

case -
report -
. -

Tacrolimus D016559
is -
a -
potent -
immunosuppressant -
that -
is -
frequently -
used -
in -
organ -
transplantation -
. -

However -
, -
adverse -
effects -
include -
cardiac -
toxicity -
. -

Herein -
we -
describe -
transient -
myocardial -
hypertrophy -
induced -
by -
tacrolimus D016559
after -
heart -
transplantation -
. -

The -
hypertrophy -
caused -
no -
clinical -
symptoms -
but -
was -
noted -
because -
of -
elevation -
of -
plasma -
brain -
natriuretic -
peptide -
concentration -
and -
confirmed -
at -
echocardiography -
. -

Initially -
, -
allograft -
rejection -
was -
feared -
; -
however -
, -
myocardial -
biopsy -
samples -
revealed -
only -
interstitial -
edema -
and -
mild -
myocardial -
hypertrophy -
; -
neither -
cellular -
nor -
humoral -
rejection -
was -
detected -
. -

The -
blood -
tacrolimus D016559
concentration -
was -
higher -
than -
usual -
at -
that -
time -
; -
thus -
, -
tacrolimus D016559
dosage -
was -
reduced -
. -

Myocardial -
hypertrophy -
completely -
resolved -
upon -
reducing -
the -
target -
concentration -
of -
tacrolimus D016559
and -
did -
not -
recur -
, -
as -
confirmed -
at -
echocardiography -
and -
myocardial -
biopsy -
. -

Thus -
, -
we -
conclude -
that -
tacrolimus D016559
induces -
reversible -
myocardial -
hypertrophy -
. -

In -
patients -
receiving -
tacrolimus D016559
therapy -
, -
blood -
concentration -
should -
be -
carefully -
controlled -
and -
extreme -
attention -
paid -
to -
cardiac -
involvement -

Although -

has -
been -
associated -
with -
the -
development -
of -
acute -
renal -
failure -
in -
greater -
than -
100 -
subjects -
, -
the -
mechanism -
of -

remains -
unclear -
. -

The -
direct -

of -
a -
single -

of -
15 -

In -

, -
a -
significant -

after -
the -

A -

However -

one -

Hypersensitivity -
to -
various -

occurred -
in -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -
the -
brainstem -
generates -
and -
propagates -
pathological -
discharges -
that -
can -
be -
elicited -
by -
mechanical -
and -
DC -
electrical -
perturbation -
. -

Cocaine D003042
was -
found -
to -
activate -
the -

and -
thus -
induce -

that -
are -
generated -
at -
the -
discharge -
site -
and -
at -
distant -
sites -
to -
which -

Ethinyl D004997
estradiol -

These -

has -
a -

When -
this -
conversion -
is -

estradiol -
treatment -
, -
sulfation -
may -
be -
an -
important -

CASE -
SUMMARY -
: -
A -
42 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
white -
man -
developed -
acute -
hypertension -
with -
severe -
headache -
and -
vomiting -
2 -
hours -

first -
doses -
of -
amisulpride C012052
100 -
mg -
and -
tiapride D063325
100 -
mg -
. -

Both -
drugs -
were -
immediately -
discontinued -
, -
and -
the -
patient -
recovered -
after -
subsequent -
nicardipine D009529
and -
verapamil D014700
treatment -
. -

Abdominal -
ultrasound -
showed -
an -
adrenal -
mass -
, -
and -
postoperative -
histologic -
examination -
confirmed -
the -
diagnosis -
of -
pheochromocytoma -
. -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Drug -
- -
induced -
symptoms -
of -
pheochromocytoma -
are -
often -
associated -
with -
the -
use -
of -
substituted -
benzamide C037689
drugs -
, -
but -
the -
underlying -
mechanism -
is -
unknown -
. -

In -
our -
case -
, -

indicated -
a -
possible -
relationship -
between -
the -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
As -
of -
March -
24 -
, -
2005 -
, -
this -
is -
the -
first -
reported -
case -
of -
amisulpride C012052
- -
and -
tiapride D063325
- -
induced -
hypertensive -
crisis -
in -
a -
patient -
with -
pheochromocytoma -
. -

Physicians -
and -
other -
healthcare -
professionals -
should -
be -
aware -
of -
this -
potential -
adverse -
effect -
of -
tiapride D063325
and -
amisulpride C012052

To -
examine -
the -
relationship -
between -
quantitative -
stimulant -
drug -
levels -
, -
catecholamines D002395
, -
and -
psychotic -
symptoms -
, -
nineteen -
patients -
in -
a -
psychiatric -
emergency -
service -
with -
a -
diagnosis -
of -
amphetamine D000661
- -
or -
cocaine D003042
- -
induced -
psychosis -
were -
interviewed -
, -
and -
plasma -
and -
urine -
were -
collected -
for -
quantitative -
assays -
of -
stimulant -
drug -
and -
catecholamine D002395
metabolite -
levels -
. -

Methamphetamine D008694
or -
amphetamine D000661
levels -
were -
related -
to -
several -
psychopathology -
scores -
and -
the -
global -
hyperkinesia -
rating -
. -

HVA -
levels -
were -
related -
to -
global -
hyperkinesia -
but -
not -
to -
psychopathology -
ratings -
. -

Although -
many -
other -
factors -
such -
as -
sensitization -
may -
play -
a -
role -
, -
intensity -
of -
stimulant -
- -
induced -
psychotic -
symptoms -
and -
stereotypies -
appears -
to -
be -
at -
least -
in -

- -
related -

Delayed -

cardiac -
arrest -
after -
diltiazem D004110
overdose -
; -
resuscitation -
with -
high -
dose -
intravenous -
calcium D002118
. -

A -
51 -
year -
old -
man -
took -
a -
mixed -
overdose -
including -
1 -
. -
8 -
- -
3 -
. -
6 -
g -
of -
diltiazem D004110
, -
paracetamol D000082
, -
aspirin D001241
, -
isosorbide D007547
nitrate D009566
, -
and -
alcohol D000431
. -

He -
initially -
presented -
to -
hospital -
after -
six -
hours -
with -
mild -
hypotension -
and -
was -
treated -
with -
activated -
charcoal -
and -
intravenous -
fluids -
. -

Eighteen -
hours -
after -
the -
overdose -
he -
had -
two -
generalised -
tonic -
- -
clonic -
seizures -
. -

The -
patient -
remained -
unresponsive -
with -
junctional -
bradycardia -
, -
unrecordable -
blood -
pressure -
, -
and -
then -
became -
asystolic -
. -

He -
was -
resuscitated -
with -
high -
dose -
( -
13 -
. -
5 -
g -
) -
intravenous -
calcium D002118
and -
adrenaline D004837
( -
epinephrine D004837
) -
. -

He -
required -
inotropic -
support -
and -
temporary -
pacing -
over -
the -
next -
48 -
hours -
. -

This -
case -
suggests -
there -
is -
a -
role -
for -
aggressive -
high -
dose -
intravenous -
calcium D002118
therapy -
in -
severe -
diltiazem D004110
overdose -
, -
particularly -
with -
the -
onset -
of -
asystole -
. -

It -
should -
be -
considered -
early -
in -
cases -
of -
cardiac -
arrest -
after -
diltiazem D004110
overdose -
. -

The -
case -

4 -
months -
after -

of -
naproxen D009288
therapy -
. -

No -
other -
factor -
predisposing -
to -
RPN -
could -
be -
discovered -
. -

Sulindac D013467
was -
substituted -
for -
naproxen D009288
and -
no -
further -
adverse -
renal -
effects -
occurred -
over -
the -
next -
12 -
months -
. -

We -
review -
previous -
reports -
linking -
RPN -
to -
antiinflammatory -
drug -
use -
and -
discuss -
possible -
advantages -
of -
sulindac D013467
in -
patients -
who -
have -
experienced -
renal -
toxicity -
from -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Our -
series -
of -
patients -
is -
representative -
of -
the -
spectrum -
of -
immunocompromised -
children -
at -
greatest -
risk -
for -

recipients -
, -
neonates -
, -
and -
children -
with -
immunodeficiency -
. -

Although -
intravenous -
ribavirin D012254
was -
not -
effective -
for -
all -
children -
with -
severe -
adenovirus -
disease -
in -
this -
series -
or -
in -
the -
literature -
, -
therapy -
is -
unlikely -
to -
be -
of -
benefit -
if -
begun -
late -
in -
the -
course -
of -
the -
infection -

, -
eg -
by -
polymerase -
chain -
reaction -
of -
those -
patients -
at -

permit -
earlier -
antiviral -
treatment -
and -
better -
evaluation -
of -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Two -
of -
5 -
children -
with -
severe -
adenovirus -
disease -
treated -
with -
intravenous -
ribavirin D012254

The -
availability -
of -
newer -

techniques -
, -
such -
as -

, -
may -
make -
earlier -

Given -
the -
seriousness -
and -
increasing -
prevalence -
of -
adenovirus -

in -
certain -
hosts -
, -

therapies -
, -
such -
as -
intravenous -
ribavirin D012254

is -
clearly -
required -

Hepatotoxicity -
of -
amiodarone D000638
. -

Amiodarone D000638
has -
proved -
very -
effective -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
otherwise -
resistant -
cardiac -
tachyarrhythmias -
. -

The -
use -
of -
amiodarone D000638
has -
, -
however -
, -
been -
limited -
due -
to -
its -
serious -
side -
- -
effects -
. -

A -
patient -
with -
cholestatic -
hepatitis -
due -
to -
amiodarone D000638
treatment -
is -
presented -
below -
and -
a -
review -
of -
the -
hepatotoxicity -
of -
amiodarone D000638
is -
given -
. -

It -
is -
concluded -
that -
solid -
evidence -
exists -
of -
hepatic -
injury -
due -
to -
amiodarone D000638
treatment -
, -
including -
steatosis -
, -
alterations -
resembling -
alcoholic -
hepatitis -
, -
cholestatic -
hepatitis -
and -
micronodular -
cirrhosis -
of -
the -
liver -
. -

Patients -
receiving -
amiodarone D000638
should -
be -
regularly -
screened -
with -
respect -
to -
hepatic -
enzyme -
levels -
. -

Therapy -
should -
be -
discontinued -
on -
the -
suspicion -
of -
cholestatic -

Previous -
studies -
demonstrated -
that -
both -
ketamine D007649
and -
morphine D009020
induced -
analgesia -
and -
catalepsy -
in -
the -
rat -
. -

Pre -
- -
treatment -
with -
ketamine D007649
produced -
cross -
- -
tolerance -
to -
morphine D009020
, -
whereas -
pretreatment -
with -
morphine D009020
did -
not -
induce -
cross -
- -
tolerance -
to -
ketamine D007649
but -
rather -
augmented -
the -
cataleptic -
response -
; -
this -
augmentation -
was -
attributed -
to -
residual -
morphine D009020
in -
the -
brain -
. -

The -
present -
studies -
explored -
the -
duration -
of -

induced -
by -
sub -
- -
effective -
doses -
of -
ketamine D007649
and -
morphine D009020
, -
administered -
simultaneously -
. -

There -
was -
mutual -
potentiation -
between -
sub -
- -
effective -
doses -
of -
ketamine D007649
and -
morphine D009020
, -
but -
sub -

effective -
doses -
of -
ketamine D007649
partly -
antagonized -
fully -

Latency -
to -
the -
loss -
of -
righting -
reflex -
, -
rigidity -
and -
behavior -
on -
recovery -
, -
reflected -
the -
relative -
predominance -
of -
ketamine D007649
or -
morphine D009020
in -
each -
combination -
. -

Naloxone D009270
inhibited -
the -
induced -
cataleptic -
effects -

The -
degree -
and -
time -
course -
of -
development -
of -
tolerance -
to -
daily -
administration -
of -
sub -
- -
effective -
dose -
combinations -
of -
ketamine D007649
and -
morphine D009020
were -
similar -
. -

Rats -
, -
tolerant -
to -
ketamine D007649
- -
dominant -
combinations -
, -
were -
cross -
- -
tolerant -
to -
both -
drugs -
, -
while -
those -
tolerant -
to -
morphine D009020
- -
dominant -
combinations -
were -
cross -
- -
tolerant -
to -
morphine D009020
but -
showed -
either -
no -
cross -
- -
tolerance -
or -
an -
augmented -
response -
to -
ketamine D007649
. -

While -
the -
mutual -
potentiation -
, -

suggest -
common -
mechanisms -
for -
the -

catalepsy -
, -
differences -
in -

Tenofovir C096918
has -
been -
implicated -
in -
the -
development -
of -

Chronic -
infection -
with -

The -
current -

treatment -
for -
HCV -
infection -
is -
combination -
therapy -
with -
pegylated -
interferon D007372

Although -
this -
regimen -
produces -
sustained -
virologic -
responses -
( -

in -
approximately -
50 -

mainly -
as -
a -
result -
of -
ribavirin D012254

and -
this -
anemia -
can -
be -
problematic -
in -
patients -
with -
HCV -
infection -
, -
especially -
those -
who -
have -
comorbid -
renal -

In -
general -
, -
anemia -
can -
increase -
the -
risk -
of -
morbidity -
and -
mortality -
, -
and -
may -
have -
negative -
effects -
on -
cerebral -
function -
and -
quality -
of -

Although -
ribavirin D012254
- -
associated -
anemia -
can -
be -
reversed -
by -
dose -
reduction -

METHODS -
: -
A -
systematic -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
The -

neuromuscular -
blocking -

( -

has -
recently -

, -
although -
the -

The -

that -
the -
PG D011453
had -
a -

The -

could -
not -
be -

RP C071693
67 -
, -
580 -
or -
SR C073839
48 -

which -
opens -
the -
possibility -
that -
the -
micturition -
reflex -
elicited -
by -
intra -
- -
arterial -
PGE2 D015232
was -
mediated -
by -
pathways -
other -
than -
the -
reflex -
initiated -
when -
the -
PG D011453
was -
given -
intravesically -
. -

The -
present -
results -
thus -
suggest -
that -
intra -
- -
arterial -
PGE2 D015232
, -
given -
near -
the -
bladder -
, -
may -
initiate -
micturition -
in -
the -
normal -
rat -
chiefly -
by -
directly -
contracting -
the -
smooth -
muscle -
of -
the -
detrusor -
. -

However -
, -
when -
given -
intravesically -
, -
PGE2 D015232
may -
stimulate -
micturition -
by -
releasing -
tachykinins D015320
from -
nerves -
in -
and -
/ -
or -
immediately -
below -
the -
urothelium -
. -

These -
tachykinins D015320
, -
in -
turn -
, -
initiate -
a -
micturition -
reflex -
by -
stimulating -
NK1 -

NK2 -
receptors -
. -

Prostanoids D011453
may -
, -
via -

contribute -
to -
both -
urge -

CASE -
: -
A -

The -
arrhythmia -
resolved -
after -
therapy -
with -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Swallowing -
- -

is -
a -
rare -
phenomenon -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Salbutamol D000420
is -
presented -
here -
as -
a -
possible -
trigger -
for -
SIAT -
. -

Although -
it -
is -
difficult -
to -
define -
causality -
in -
a -
case -
report -
, -
it -
is -
logical -
to -
think -
that -
a -
beta -
- -
agonist -
like -
salbutamol D000420
( -
known -
to -
induce -
tachycardia -
) -
may -
be -
the -
trigger -
of -
adrenergic -
reflexes -
originating -
in -
the -
esophagus -
while -
swallowing -
and -
that -
a -
beta -
- -
blocker -
such -
as -
atenolol D001262
( -
that -
blocks -
the -
adrenergic -
activity -
) -
may -

Metformin D008687
treatment -
fully -

This -
was -

These -
in -

correction -
by -
metformin D008687
were -
complemented -
by -

We -
found -
that -
gentamicin D005839
treatment -
depleted -
respiratory -
components -
( -
cytochrome -
c -
, -
NADH -
) -
, -
probably -
due -
to -
the -
opening -

These -

Thus -
, -
our -

RESULTS -
: -
The -
results -
indicate -
that -
ciprofloxacin D002939

Hypoxia -

Despite -
the -

need -
to -

tissue -
oxygenation -
at -
the -
cellular -
level -
, -
relatively -
few -
methods -
have -
been -
available -
. -

In -
this -
study -
, -
we -
developed -
a -
new -
hypoxia -

using -
a -
hypoxia -

responsive -
element -
of -
the -

vascular -

untranslated -
region -
and -
generated -
a -
novel -

. -

We -
then -
applied -
this -
animal -
model -
to -
the -
detection -
of -
tubulointerstitial -
hypoxia -
in -
the -
diseased -
kidney -
. -

With -
this -
model -
, -
we -
were -
able -
to -
identify -
diffuse -
cortical -
hypoxia -
in -
the -
puromycin D011692
aminonucleoside -
- -
induced -
nephrotic -
syndrome -
and -
focal -
and -
segmental -
hypoxia -
in -
the -
remnant -
kidney -
model -
. -

Expression -
of -
the -
hypoxia -
- -
responsive -
transgene -
increased -
throughout -
the -
observation -
period -
, -
reaching -
2 -
. -
2 -
- -
fold -
at -
2 -
weeks -
in -
the -

6 -

fold -
at -
4 -
weeks -
in -
the -

model -
, -
whereas -
that -
of -

showed -
a -
mild -
decrease -
, -
reflecting -
distinct -
behaviors -
of -
the -
two -
genes -
. -

The -
degree -
of -
hypoxia -
showed -
a -
positive -
correlation -
with -
microscopic -
tubulointerstitial -
injury -
in -
both -
models -
. -

Finally -
, -
we -

We -

significant -
transplant -

have -
been -
observed -

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
the -
peak -

was -
followed -
by -
that -

Topiramate C052342
- -
induced -
nephrolithiasis -
. -

Topiramate C052342
is -
a -
recently -
developed -
antiepileptic -
medication -
that -
is -
becoming -
more -
widely -
prescribed -
because -
of -
its -
efficacy -
in -
treating -
refractory -
seizures -
. -

Urologists -
should -
be -
aware -
that -
this -
medication -
can -
cause -
metabolic -
acidosis -
in -
patients -
secondary -
to -
inhibition -
of -
carbonic -
anhydrase -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
a -
distal -
tubular -
acidification -
defect -
may -
result -
, -
thus -
impairing -
the -
normal -
compensatory -
drop -
in -
urine -
pH -
. -

These -
factors -
can -
lead -
to -
the -
development -
of -
calcium C020243

Selective -
distal -

seems -
to -
be -
responsible -
for -
the -
profound -

that -
is -
a -
major -
clinical -
side -
effect -
of -

with -
AmB D000666
. -

Potassium D011188
depletion -
also -
potentiates -
the -
tubular -
toxicity -
of -
AmB D000666
. -

This -
study -
was -
designed -
to -
assess -
the -
ability -
of -
spironolactone D013148
to -
reduce -
potassium D011188
requirements -
and -
to -
prevent -
hypokalemia -
in -
neutropenic -
patients -
on -
AmB D000666
treatment -
. -

METHODS -
: -
In -
this -
study -
26 -
patients -
with -
various -
hematological -
disorders -
were -
randomized -
to -
receive -
either -
intravenous -
AmB D000666
alone -
or -
AmB D000666
and -
oral -
spironolactone D013148
100 -
mg -
twice -
daily -
when -
developing -

infection -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Patients -
receiving -
concomitant -
AmB D000666
and -
spironolactone D013148
had -
significantly -
higher -

than -
those -
receiving -
AmB D000666
alone -
( -

) -
. -

Those -
patients -
receiving -
AmB D000666
and -
spironolactone D013148
required -
significantly -
less -
potassium D011188
supplementation -
to -

potassium D011188
within -
the -
normal -
range -
( -
P -

Moreover -
, -
urinary -
potassium D011188

CONCLUSION -
: -
This -
study -
showed -
that -
spironolactone D013148
can -
reduce -
potassium D011188
requirements -
and -
prevent -

Dopamine D004298
( -
DA D004298
) -
, -
through -
D1 -

D2 -
receptor -
- -
mediated -
signaling -
, -
plays -
a -
major -
role -
in -
the -
control -
of -
epileptic -
seizures -
arising -
in -
the -
limbic -
system -
. -

Excitotoxicity -
leading -
to -
neuronal -
cell -
death -
in -
the -
affected -
areas -
is -
a -
major -
consequence -
of -
seizures -
at -
the -
cellular -
level -
. -

In -
this -
respect -
, -
little -
is -
known -
about -
the -
role -
of -
DA D004298
receptors -
in -
the -
occurrence -
of -
epilepsy -
- -
induced -
neuronal -
cell -
death -
. -

Here -
we -
analyze -
the -
occurrence -
of -
seizures -
and -
neurotoxicity -
in -
D2R -
- -
/ -
- -
mice -
treated -
with -
the -
cholinergic -
agonist -
pilocarpine D010862
. -

We -
compared -
these -
results -
with -
those -
previously -
obtained -
with -
kainic D007608
acid -
( -
KA D007608
) -
, -
a -
potent -
glutamate D018698
agonist -
. -

Importantly -
, -
D2R -
- -
/ -
- -
mice -
develop -
seizures -
at -
doses -
of -
both -
drugs -
that -
are -
not -
epileptogenic -
for -
WT -
littermates -
and -
show -
greater -
neurotoxicity -
. -

However -
, -
pilocarpine D010862
- -
induced -
seizures -
result -
in -
a -
more -
widespread -
neuronal -
death -
in -
both -
WT -
and -
D2R -
- -
/ -
- -
brains -
in -
comparison -
to -
KA D007608
. -

Thus -
, -
the -
absence -
of -
D2R -
lowers -
the -
threshold -
for -
seizures -
induced -
by -
both -
glutamate D018698
and -
acetylcholine D000109
. -

Moreover -
, -
the -
dopaminergic -
control -
of -
epilepsy -
- -
induced -
neurodegeneration -
seems -
to -
be -
mediated -
by -
distinct -
interactions -
of -
D2R -
signaling -
with -
these -
two -
neurotransmitters -

suggested -
that -
the -

The -

This -

the -
alterations -
of -
plasma -
lipoproteins -
found -

were -
due -

, -
or -
, -
at -

in -

to -
the -
aminonucleoside D011692

The -
purpose -
of -
the -
present -
study -
was -
to -
investigate -
the -
changes -
in -
plasma -
and -
urinary -
lipoproteins -
during -
the -
administration -
of -
puromycin D011692
aminonucleoside -
( -
20 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
for -
7 -
days -
) -
and -
the -
subsequent -
development -
of -
nephrotic -
syndrome -
. -

Since -
massive -
albuminuria -
occurred -
after -
6 -
days -
of -
treatment -
, -
the -
time -
- -
course -
study -
was -
divided -
into -
two -
stages -
: -
pre -
- -
nephrotic -
stage -
( -
day -
1 -
- -
5 -
) -
and -
nephrotic -
stage -
( -
day -
6 -
- -
11 -
) -
. -

In -
pre -
- -
nephrotic -
stage -
the -
plasma -
level -
of -
fatty D005227
acids -
, -
triacylglycerol D014280
and -
VLDL -
decreased -
while -
that -
of -
phospholipid -
, -
cholesteryl D002788
esters -
and -
HDL -
remained -
constant -
. -

Plasma -
apolipoprotein -
A -
- -
I -
tended -
to -
increase -
( -
40 -
% -
increase -
at -
day -
5 -
) -
. -

At -
the -
beginning -
of -
nephrotic -
stage -
( -
day -
6 -
) -
the -
concentration -
of -
plasma -
albumin -
dropped -
to -
a -
very -
low -
level -
, -
while -
that -
of -
apolipoprotein -
A -
- -
I -
increased -
abruptly -
( -
4 -
- -
fold -
increase -
) -
and -
continued -
to -
rise -
, -
although -
less -
steeply -
, -
in -
the -
following -
days -
. -

The -
plasma -
concentration -
of -
HDL -
followed -
the -
same -
pattern -
. -

Plasma -
VLDL -
and -
LDL -
increased -
at -
a -
later -
stage -
( -
day -
9 -
) -
. -

Plasma -
apolipoprotein -
A -
- -
I -
was -
found -
not -
only -
in -
HDL -
( -
1 -
. -
063 -
- -
1 -
. -
210 -
g -
/ -
ml -
) -
but -
also -
in -
the -
LDL -
density -
class -
( -
1 -
. -
025 -
- -
1 -
. -
050 -
g -
/ -
ml -
) -
. -

In -
the -
pre -
- -
nephrotic -
stage -
lipoproteinuria -
was -
negligible -
, -
while -
in -
the -
early -
nephrotic -
stage -
the -
urinary -
loss -
of -
plasma -
lipoproteins -
consisted -
mainly -
of -
HDL -
. -

These -
observations -
indicate -
that -
puromycin D011692
aminonucleoside -
alters -
plasma -
lipoproteins -
by -
lowering -
VLDL -
and -
increasing -
HDL -
. -

It -
is -
likely -
that -
the -
early -
and -
striking -
increase -
of -
plasma -
HDL -
found -
in -
nephrotic -
rats -
is -
related -
to -
a -
direct -
effect -
of -
the -
drug -
on -
HDL -
metabolism -

Circulating -

The -
activities -
of -
the -
lysosomal -
enzymes -
acid -
and -
neutral -
protease -
, -
N -
- -
acetylglucosaminidase -
, -
and -
acid -
phosphatase -
were -
measured -
in -
the -
serum -
of -
patients -
with -
fulminant -
hepatic -
failure -
. -

Acid -
protease -
( -
cathepsin -
D -
) -
activity -
was -
increased -
about -
tenfold -
in -
patients -
who -
died -
and -
nearly -
fourfold -
in -
those -
who -
survived -
fulminant -
hepatic -
failure -
after -
paracetamol D000082
overdose -
, -
whereas -
activities -
were -
increased -
equally -
in -
patients -
with -
fulminant -
hepatic -
failure -
due -
to -
viral -
hepatitis -
whether -
or -
not -
they -
survived -
. -

A -
correlation -
was -
found -
between -
serum -
acid -
protease -
activity -
and -
prothrombin -
time -
, -
and -
the -
increase -
in -
cathepsin -
D -
activity -
was -
sustained -
over -
several -
days -
compared -
with -
aspartate D001224
aminotransferase -
, -
which -
showed -
a -
sharp -
early -
peak -
and -
then -
a -
fall -
. -

Circulating -
lysosomal -
proteases -
can -
damage -
other -
organs -
, -
and -
measurement -
of -
their -
activity -
may -
therefore -
be -
of -
added -
value -
in -
assessing -
prognosis -
in -
this -
condition -

We -
found -
that -
the -
above -
- -
mentioned -
patient -
and -
one -
of -
the -
diabetic -
kindreds -
with -
no -

had -
abnormal -

These -

suggest -
a -

and -
the -
patient -
with -

Mechanisms -
of -
myocardial -
ischemia -
induced -
by -

: -
comparison -
with -

- -
induced -
ischemia -
. -

The -
role -
of -
epinephrine D004837
in -
eliciting -
myocardial -
ischemia -
was -
examined -
in -
patients -
with -
coronary -
artery -
disease -
. -

Objective -
signs -
of -
ischemia -
and -
factors -
increasing -
myocardial -
oxygen D010100
consumption -
were -
compared -
during -
epinephrine D004837
infusion -
and -
supine -
bicycle -
exercise -
. -

Both -
epinephrine D004837
and -
exercise -
produced -
myocardial -
ischemia -
as -
evidenced -
by -
ST -
segment -
depression -
and -
angina -
. -

However -
, -
the -
mechanisms -
of -
myocardial -
ischemia -
induced -
by -
epinephrine D004837
were -
significantly -
different -
from -
those -
of -
exercise -
. -

Exercise -
- -
induced -
myocardial -
ischemia -
was -
marked -
predominantly -
by -
increased -
heart -
rate -
and -
rate -
- -
pressure -
product -
with -
a -
minor -
contribution -
of -
end -
- -
diastolic -
volume -
, -
while -
epinephrine D004837
- -
induced -
ischemia -
was -
characterized -
by -
a -
marked -
increase -
in -
contractility -
and -
a -
less -
pronounced -
increase -
in -
heart -
rate -
and -
rate -
- -
pressure -
product -
. -

These -
findings -
indicate -
that -
ischemia -
produced -
by -
epinephrine D004837
, -
as -
may -
occur -
during -
states -
of -
emotional -

We -
conclude -
that -

several -
drawbacks -
, -
including -
hypercalcemia -
and -

This -
study -
was -
undertaken -
to -
determine -
the -
effects -
of -
OCT C051883
on -
serum -
PTH -
levels -
and -
bone -
turnover -
in -
states -
of -
normal -
or -
impaired -
renal -

. -

METHODS -
: -
Sixty -
dogs -
were -
either -
nephrectomized -
( -

) -
or -

. -

The -
animals -
received -
supplemental -
phosphate D010710
to -
enhance -
PTH -
secretion -
. -

Fourteen -
weeks -
after -
the -
start -
of -
phosphate D010710
supplementation -
, -
half -
of -
the -
Nx -
and -
Sham -
dogs -
received -
doses -
of -
OCT C051883
( -
three -
times -
per -
week -
) -
; -
the -
other -
half -
were -
given -
vehicle -
for -
60 -
weeks -
. -

Thereafter -
, -
the -
treatment -
modalities -
for -
a -
subset -
of -
animals -
were -
crossed -
over -
for -
an -
additional -
eight -
months -
. -

Biochemical -
and -
hormonal -
indices -
of -
calcium D002118
and -
bone -
metabolism -
were -
measured -
throughout -
the -
study -
, -
and -
bone -
biopsies -
were -
done -
at -
baseline -
, -
60 -
weeks -
after -
OCT C051883
or -
vehicle -
treatment -
, -
and -
at -
the -
end -
of -
the -
crossover -
period -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
In -
Nx -
dogs -
, -
OCT C051883
significantly -
decreased -
serum -
PTH -
levels -
soon -
after -
the -
induction -
of -
renal -
insufficiency -
. -

In -
long -

secondary -
hyperparathyroidism -
, -
OCT C051883
( -

. -
03 -
microg -
/ -

) -
stabilized -
serum -
PTH -
levels -
during -
the -
first -
months -
. -

Serum -
PTH -
levels -
rose -
thereafter -
, -
but -
the -
rise -
was -
less -
pronounced -
compared -
with -
baseline -
than -
the -
rise -
seen -
in -
Nx -
control -
. -

These -
effects -
were -
accompanied -
by -
episodes -
of -
hypercalcemia -
and -
hyperphosphatemia -
. -

In -
animals -
with -
normal -
renal -
function -
, -
OCT C051883
induced -
a -
transient -
decrease -
in -
serum -
PTH -
levels -
at -
a -
dose -
of -
0 -
. -
1 -
microg -
/ -
kg -
, -
which -
was -
not -
sustained -
with -
lowering -
of -
the -
doses -
. -

In -
Nx -
dogs -
, -
OCT C051883
reversed -
abnormal -
bone -
formation -
, -
such -
as -
woven -
osteoid -
and -
fibrosis -
, -
but -
did -
not -
significantly -
alter -
the -
level -
of -
bone -
turnover -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
OCT C051883
improved -
mineralization -
lag -
time -
, -
( -
that -
is -
, -
the -
rate -
at -
which -
osteoid -
mineralizes -
) -
in -
both -
Nx -
and -
Sham -
dogs -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
These -
results -
indicate -
that -
even -
though -
OCT C051883
does -
not -
completely -
prevent -
the -
occurrence -
of -
hypercalcemia -
in -
experimental -
dogs -
with -
renal -
insufficiency -
, -
it -
may -
be -
of -
use -
in -
the -
management -
of -
secondary -
hyperparathyroidism -
because -
it -
does -
not -
induce -
low -
bone -
turnover -
and -
, -
therefore -
, -
does -
not -
increase -
the -
risk -
of -
adynamic -
bone -
disease -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Hypotension -
is -
a -
major -
contributor -
to -
mortality -
in -
tricyclic -
antidepressant -

. -

Recent -
data -
suggest -
that -
tricyclic -

Hepatitis -
B -
virus -
( -

infection -
, -
which -
causes -
liver -
cirrhosis -

, -
remains -

health -
problem -
in -
Asian -
countries -

Recent -
development -
of -

is -
reported -
to -
be -
successful -
in -
reducing -
the -
size -

chronically -
infected -
carriers -
, -
although -
the -
standard -
medical -
therapies -
have -
not -
been -
established -
up -

In -
this -
report -
, -
we -
encountered -
a -
patient -
with -
decompensated -
HBV -
- -
related -
cirrhosis -
who -
exhibited -
the -
dramatic -
improvements -
after -
antiviral -
therapy -
. -

The -
patient -
was -
a -
50 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
woman -
. -

Previous -
conventional -
medical -
treatments -
were -
not -
effective -
for -
this -
patient -
, -
thus -
this -
patient -
had -
been -
referred -
to -
our -
hospital -
. -

However -
, -
the -
administration -
of -
lamivudine D019259
, -
a -
reverse -
transcriptase -
inhibitor -
, -
for -
23 -
months -
dramatically -
improved -
her -
liver -
severity -
. -

During -
this -
period -
, -
no -
drug -
resistant -
mutant -
HBV -
emerged -
, -
and -
the -
serum -
HBV -
- -
DNA -
level -
was -
continuously -
suppressed -
. -

These -
virological -
responses -
were -
also -
maintained -
even -
after -
the -
antiviral -
therapy -
was -
discontinued -
. -

Moreover -
, -
both -
hepatitis D006514|D006513
B -
surface -
antigen -
and -
e -
antigen -
were -
observed -
to -
have -
disappeared -
in -
this -
patient -
. -

The -
administration -
of -
lamivudine D019259
to -
patients -
with -
HBV -
- -
related -
cirrhosis -
, -
like -
our -
present -
case -
, -
should -
be -
considered -
as -
an -
initial -
medical -
therapeutic -
option -

especially -
in -
countries -
where -
liver -
transplantation -
is -

Melatonin D008550
pre -

manner -
barbiturate C032232
narcosis -
, -
however -
, -
no -

was -
found -

In -

reduced -

prolonged -
the -

narcosis -
. -

In -
contrast -
, -
the -
highest -
dose -
of -
melatonin D008550
( -
50 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
) -
caused -
a -
paradoxical -
increase -
in -
the -
latency -
and -
produced -
a -
sustained -
reduction -
of -
the -
duration -
of -
narcosis -
, -
and -
a -
reduction -
in -
mortality -
rate -
. -

Melatonin D008550
0 -
. -
5 -
and -

not -
the -

Thus -
, -
the -
dual -

pharmacological -
narcosis -
seems -
to -
be -
specific -
for -

In -

Tubular -
damage -
produced -

was -
discriminated -
both -
quantitatively -
and -
qualitatively -
from -
glomerular -
damage -
produced -
by -
PAN D011692

The -
latter -
was -
characterized -
by -
a -
pronounced -
increase -
in -
protein -

, -
especially -
proteins -
with -
molecular -

In -
contrast -
, -
protein -

only -
slightly -
and -
characterized -
by -
excretion -
of -

Proximal -
tubular -
damage -
caused -
by -
HCBD C001335
and -
papillary -
damage -
caused -
by -
BEA C004504
were -
distinguished -
both -
by -
conventional -
urinalysis -
( -
volume -
and -
specific -
gravity -
) -
and -
by -
measurement -
of -
the -
two -
urinary -
enzymes -
. -

Alkaline -
phosphatase -
and -
glucose D005947
were -
markedly -
and -
transiently -
elevated -
in -
proximal -
tubular -

and -
N -
- -
acetyl -
- -
beta -
- -
glucosaminidase -
showed -
a -
sustained -
elevation -
in -
papillary -

. -

It -
is -
concluded -
that -
both -
selective -
urinary -
enzymes -
and -
the -
molecular -
weight -
pattern -
of -
urinary -
proteins -
can -
be -
used -
to -
provide -

Phenobarbital D010634
( -
PB D010634

INTRODUCTION -
: -
Ethambutol D004977
is -
used -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
tuberculosis -
, -
which -
is -
still -
prevalent -
in -
Southeast -
Asia -
, -
and -
can -
be -
associated -
with -
permanent -
visual -
loss -
. -

We -
report -
3 -
cases -
which -
presented -
with -
bitemporal -
hemianopia -
. -

CLINICAL -
PICTURE -
: -
Three -
patients -
with -
ethambutol D004977
- -
associated -
toxic -
optic -
neuropathy -
are -
described -
. -

All -
3 -
patients -
had -
loss -
of -
central -
visual -
acuity -
, -
colour -
vision -
( -
Ishihara -
) -
and -
visual -
field -
. -

The -
visual -
field -
loss -
had -
a -
bitemporal -
flavour -
, -
suggesting -
involvement -
of -
the -
optic -
chiasm -
. -

TREATMENT -
: -
Despite -
stopping -
ethambutol D004977
on -
diagnosis -
, -
visual -
function -
continued -
to -
deteriorate -
for -
a -
few -
months -
. -

Subsequent -
improvement -
was -
mild -
in -
2 -
cases -
. -

In -
the -
third -
case -
, -
visual -
acuity -
and -
colour -
vision -
normalised -
but -
the -
optic -
discs -
were -
pale -
. -

OUTCOME -
: -
All -
3 -
patients -
had -
some -
permanent -
loss -
of -
visual -
function -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Ethambutol D004977
usage -
is -
associated -
with -
permanent -
visual -
loss -
and -
should -
be -
avoided -
if -
possible -

The -
author -
postulates -
that -
in -
cases -
of -
ethambutol D004977
associated -
chiasmopathy -
, -
ethambutol D004977
may -
initially -
affect -
the -
optic -
nerves -
and -
subsequently -
progress -
to -
involve -

In -
this -
study -
we -
investigated -
tolerability -

we -
evaluated -
whether -

However -
, -
the -

is -
statistically -
increased -
by -
a -

BACKGROUND -
: -
More -
than -
3 -
decades -
after -
Jones -
and -
Smith -
( -
1973 -
) -
reported -
on -
the -
devastation -
caused -
by -
alcohol D000431
exposure -
on -
fetal -
development -
, -
the -
rates -
of -
heavy -
drinking -
during -
pregnancy -
remain -
relatively -
unchanged -
. -

Early -
identification -
of -
fetal -
alcohol D000431
exposure -
and -
maternal -
abstinence -
led -
to -
better -
infant -
outcomes -
. -

This -
study -
examined -
the -
utility -
of -
biometry -
for -
detecting -
alcohol D000431
- -
related -
fetal -
growth -
impairment -
. -

METHODS -
: -
We -
obtained -
fetal -
ultrasound -
measures -
from -
routine -
ultrasound -
examinations -
for -
167 -
pregnant -
hazardous -
drinkers -
who -
were -
enrolled -
in -
a -
brief -
alcohol D000431
intervention -
study -
. -

The -
fetal -
measures -
for -
women -
who -
quit -
after -
learning -
of -
their -
pregnancies -
were -
compared -
with -
measures -
for -
women -
who -
continued -
some -
drinking -
throughout -
the -
course -
of -
their -
pregnancies -
. -

Because -
intensity -
of -
alcohol D000431
consumption -
is -
associated -
with -
poorer -
fetal -
outcomes -
, -
separate -
analyses -
were -
conducted -
for -
the -
heavy -

average -
of -
> -
or -
= -
5 -
drinks -

) -
alcohol D000431
consumers -
. -

Fetal -
measures -
from -
the -
heavy -
- -
exposed -
fetuses -
were -
also -
compared -
with -
measures -
from -
a -
nondrinking -
group -
that -
was -
representative -
of -
normal -
, -
uncomplicated -
pregnancies -
from -
our -
clinics -
. -

Analyses -
of -
covariance -
were -
used -
to -
determine -
whether -
there -
were -
differences -
between -
groups -
after -
controlling -
for -
influences -
of -
gestational -
age -
and -
drug -
abuse -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Nearly -
half -
of -
the -
pregnant -
drinkers -
abstained -
after -
learning -
of -
their -
pregnancies -
. -

When -
women -
reportedly -
quit -
drinking -
early -
in -
their -
pregnancies -
, -
fetal -
growth -
measures -
were -
not -
significantly -
different -
from -
a -
non -
- -
alcohol D000431
- -
exposed -
group -
, -
regardless -
of -
prior -
drinking -
patterns -
. -

Any -
alcohol D000431
consumption -
postpregnancy -
recognition -
among -
the -
heavy -
drinkers -
resulted -
in -
reduced -
cerebellar -
growth -
as -
well -
as -
decreased -
cranial -
to -
body -
growth -
in -
comparison -
with -
women -
who -
either -
quit -
drinking -
or -
who -
were -
nondrinkers -
. -

Amphetamine D000661
abuse -
was -
predictive -
of -
larger -
cranial -
to -
body -
growth -
ratios -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Alterations -
in -
fetal -
biometric -
measurements -
were -
observed -
among -
the -
heavy -
drinkers -
only -
when -
they -
continued -
drinking -
after -
becoming -
aware -
of -
their -
pregnancies -
. -

Although -
the -
reliance -
on -
self -
- -
reported -

is -
a -
limitation -
in -
this -
study -
, -
these -
findings -
support -
the -
benefits -
of -

CASE -
SUMMARY -
: -
A -
70 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
healthy -
woman -
from -
Iraq -
developed -
acute -
cholestatic -
hepatitis -
3 -
weeks -
following -
repair -
of -
the -
right -
rotator -
cuff -
under -
general -
anesthesia -
. -

There -
was -
no -
evidence -
for -
viral -
, -
autoimmune -
, -
or -
metabolic -
causes -
of -
hepatitis -
. -

No -
other -
medications -
were -
involved -
except -
for -
dipyrone D004177
for -
analgesia -
. -

The -
alanine D000409
aminotransferase -
was -
elevated -
to -
a -
peak -
concentration -
of -
1533 -
U -
/ -
L -
and -
the -
serum -
bilirubin D001663
reached -
a -
peak -
of -
17 -
. -
0 -
mg -
/ -
dL -
. -

There -
was -
slow -
improvement -
over -
4 -
months -
. -

Accidental -
reexposure -
by -
the -
patient -
to -
dipyrone D004177
was -
uneventful -
. -

DISCUSSION -
: -
The -
clinical -
and -
histologic -
picture -
of -
this -
case -
resembles -
halothane -
hepatitis -
, -
which -
has -
a -
significant -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Isoflurane D007530
, -
a -
common -
anesthetic -
agent -

It -
has -
been -
proposed -
that -
nitric D009569
oxide -
( -
NO D009569
) -
induced -
headache -
in -

may -
be -
associated -
with -

In -
the -

we -
aimed -
to -
investigate -

were -
collected -
at -
baseline -

60 -
min -
after -
start -

Both -
patients -
and -

developed -
significantly -
stronger -
immediate -
headache -
on -
the -
GTN D005996
day -
than -
on -
the -
placebo -
day -
and -
the -
headache -
was -
significantly -
more -
pronounced -
in -
patients -
than -
in -
controls -
. -

There -
was -
no -
difference -
between -
the -
area -
under -
the -
CGRP -
curve -
( -
AUCCGRP -
) -
on -
GTN D005996
vs -

The -
AUCCGRP -
recorded -
on -

did -
not -
differ -
between -
patients -
and -

The -
present -
study -
indicates -
that -
NO D009569
- -
induced -
immediate -

is -
not -
associated -
with -

Dobutamine D004280

echocardiography -
( -
DSE -
) -
is -
a -
useful -
and -
safe -
provocation -
test -
for -
myocardial -

. -

Until -
now -
, -
the -
test -
has -
been -
focused -
only -
on -
the -
organic -
lesion -
in -
the -
coronary -
artery -

and -
positive -
DSE -
has -
indicated -
the -
presence -
of -
significant -
fixed -
coronary -
artery -
stenosis -
. -

The -
aim -
of -
the -
present -
study -
is -
to -
examine -
whether -
myocardial -
ischemia -
due -
to -
coronary -
spasm -
is -
induced -
by -
dobutamine D004280
. -

We -
performed -
DSE -
on -
51 -
patients -
with -
coronary -
spastic -
angina -
but -
without -
significant -
fixed -
coronary -
artery -
stenosis -
. -

All -
patients -
had -
anginal -
attacks -
at -
rest -
with -
ST -
elevation -
on -
the -
electrocardiogram -
( -
variant -
angina -
) -
. -

Coronary -
spasm -
was -
induced -
by -
intracoronary -
injection -
of -
acetylcholine D000109
, -
and -
no -
fixed -
coronary -
artery -
stenosis -
was -
documented -
on -
angiograms -
in -
all -
patients -
. -

DSE -
was -
performed -
with -
intravenous -
dobutamine D004280
infusion -
with -
an -
incremental -
doses -
of -
5 -
, -
10 -
, -

every -
5 -
minutes -
. -

Of -
the -
51 -
patients -
, -
7 -
patients -
showed -
asynergy -
with -
ST -
elevation -
. -

All -
7 -
patients -
( -
13 -
. -
7 -
% -
) -
had -
chest -
pain -
during -
asynergy -
, -
and -
both -
chest -
pain -
and -
electrocardiographic -
changes -
were -
preceded -
by -
asynergy -
. -

These -
findings -
indicate -
that -
dobutamine D004280
can -
provoke -
coronary -
spasm -
in -
some -
patients -
with -
coronary -
spastic -
angina -
. -

When -
DSE -
is -
performed -
to -
evaluate -
coronary -
artery -
disease -
, -
not -
only -
fixed -
coronary -
stenosis -
, -
but -
also -
coronary -
spasm -
should -
be -
considered -
as -
a -
genesis -
of -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
CBDCA D016190
is -
neurotoxic -
in -
our -
model -

and -
the -
type -
of -
pathological -
changes -
it -

it -
is -
probable -
that -

is -
induced -
in -
the -
two -
drugs -
by -
the -

A -

We -
strongly -

were -
based -
on -

treatment -
history -
was -
obtained -
from -
the -

RESULTS -
: -
Hyperprolactinemia -

by -
hyperprolactinemia -
. -

As -
expected -
, -
bone -

, -
we -
also -
found -
treatment -
with -
selective -

These -
findings -
became -
more -
marked -
when -
the -
analysis -
was -
restricted -
to -
non -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
This -
is -
the -
first -
study -
to -
link -
risperidone D018967
- -
induced -
hyperprolactinemia -
and -
SSRI -

Heparin D006493
is -
a -
commonly -
implemented -
anticoagulant -
used -
to -
treat -
critically -
ill -
patients -
. -

Recently -
, -
a -
number -
of -
commercial -
lots -
of -
heparin D006493
products -
were -
found -
to -
be -
contaminated -
with -
an -
oversulfated -
chondroitin D002809
sulfate -
( -
OSCS -
) -
derivative -
that -
could -
elicit -
a -
hypotensive -
response -
in -
pigs -
following -
a -
single -
high -
- -
dose -
infusion -
. -

Using -
both -
contaminated -
heparin D006493
products -
and -
the -
synthetically -
produced -
derivative -
, -
we -
showed -
that -
the -
OSCS -
produces -
dose -
- -

hypotension -
in -
pigs -
. -

The -
no -
observed -
effect -
level -
( -
NOEL -
) -
for -
this -
contaminant -
appears -
to -
be -
approximately -
1mg -
/ -
kg -
, -
corresponding -
to -
a -
contamination -
level -
of -
approximately -
3 -
% -
. -

We -
also -
demonstrated -
that -
OSCS -
can -
be -
identified -
in -
heparin D006493
products -
using -
a -
simple -
, -
inexpensive -
, -
commercially -
available -
heparin D006493
enzyme -
immunoassay -
( -

kit -
that -
has -
a -
limit -
of -
detection -
of -
approximately -
0 -
. -
1 -
% -
, -
well -
below -
the -
NOEL -
. -

This -
kit -
may -
provide -
a -
useful -
method -
to -
test -
heparin D006493
products -
for -

To -

the -

kinin -
B1 -
receptor -
( -
B1R -

during -
the -

DOX D004317
control -
mice -
showed -
cardiac -
dysfunction -
measured -

This -
was -

an -
increased -

Furthermore -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Vitamin D001205
C -
acts -

Experimental -
cranial -
pain -
elicited -
by -
capsaicin D002211
: -
a -
PET -
study -
. -

Using -
a -
positron -
emission -
tomography -
( -
PET -
) -
study -
it -
was -
shown -
recently -
that -
in -
migraine -
without -
aura -
certain -
areas -
in -
the -
brain -
stem -
were -
activated -
during -
the -
headache -
state -
, -
but -
not -
in -
the -
headache -
free -
interval -
. -

It -
was -
suggested -
that -
this -
brain -
stem -
activation -
is -
inherent -
to -
the -
migraine -
attack -
itself -
and -
represents -
the -
so -
called -
' -
migraine -
generator -
' -
. -

To -
test -
this -
hypothesis -
we -
performed -
an -
experimental -
pain -
study -
in -
seven -
healthy -
volunteers -
, -
using -
the -
same -
positioning -
in -
the -
PET -
scanner -
as -
in -
the -
migraine -
patients -
. -

A -
small -
amount -
of -
capsaicin D002211
was -
administered -
subcutaneously -
in -
the -
right -
forehead -
to -
evoke -
a -
burning -
painful -
sensation -
in -
the -
first -
division -
of -
the -
trigeminal -
nerve -
. -

Increases -
of -
regional -
cerebral -
blood -
flow -
( -
rCBF -
) -
were -
found -
bilaterally -
in -
the -
insula -
, -
in -
the -
anterior -
cingulate -
cortex -
, -
the -
cavernous -
sinus -
and -
the -
cerebellum -
. -

Using -
the -
same -
stereotactic -
space -
limits -
as -
in -
the -
above -
mentioned -
migraine -
study -
no -
brain -
stem -
activation -
was -
found -
in -
the -
acute -
pain -
state -
compared -
to -
the -
pain -
free -
state -
. -

The -
increase -
of -
activation -
in -
the -
region -
of -
the -
cavernous -
sinus -
however -
, -
suggests -
that -
this -
structure -
is -
more -
likely -
to -
be -
involved -
in -
trigeminal -
transmitted -
pain -
as -
such -
, -
rather -
than -
in -
a -
specific -
type -
of -
headache -

was -
suggested -
for -

Neuroleptic -
malignant -
syndrome -
with -
risperidone D018967
. -

Neuroleptic -
malignant -
syndrome -
is -
thought -
to -
be -
a -
result -
of -
dopamine D004298
D2 -
receptor -
blockade -
in -
the -
striatum -
of -
the -
basal -
ganglia -

Risperidone D018967
, -
a -
benzisoxazole C441200

has -
high -
serotonin D012701
5 -
- -
HT2 -
receptor -
blockade -
and -
dose -
- -
related -
D2 -
receptor -
blockade -
. -

The -
high -
ratio -
is -
believed -
to -
impart -
the -
low -
frequency -
of -
extrapyramidal -
symptoms -
with -
risperidone D018967
at -
low -
dosages -
. -

With -
this -
low -
frequency -
of -
extrapyramidal -
symptoms -
, -
it -
was -
thought -
the -
frequency -
of -
neuroleptic -
malignant -
syndrome -
might -
also -
be -
lowered -
. -

A -
73 -

risperidone D018967
and -
starting -
treatment -
with -
dantrolene D003620
and -
bromocriptine D001971

It -
appears -
that -
the -
protection -
from -
extrapyramidal -
side -
effects -
observed -
with -
risperidone D018967
does -
not -
ensure -
protection -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Hallucinations -
as -
a -
symptom -
of -
central -
neurotoxicity -
are -
a -
known -
but -
poorly -
described -
side -
effect -
of -
ifosfamide D007069
. -

Most -
cases -
of -
ifosfamide D007069
- -
induced -
hallucinations -
have -
been -
reported -
with -
other -
mental -
status -
changes -
. -

METHODS -
: -
The -
authors -
interviewed -
six -
persons -
with -
ifosfamide D007069
- -
induced -
hallucinations -
in -
the -
presence -
of -
a -

receiving -
high -
- -
dose -
ifosfamide D007069
as -
part -
of -
their -
bone -

procedure -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Hallucinations -
occurred -
only -
when -
the -
patient -
' -
s -
eyes -
were -
closed -
and -
, -
in -
all -
but -
one -
case -
, -
were -
reported -
as -
disturbing -
or -
frightening -
. -

Underreporting -
of -
these -
hallucinations -
by -
patients -
is -
likely -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Hallucinations -
may -
be -
the -
sole -
or -
first -
manifestation -
of -
neurotoxicity -
. -

The -
incidence -
may -
be -
dose -

The -
clinician -
should -
be -
alerted -
for -
possible -
ifosfamide D007069
- -

hallucinations -
, -
which -
may -
occur -
without -

Cardiac -
transplantation -
: -
improved -
quality -
of -
survival -
with -
a -
modified -
immunosuppressive -
protocol -
. -

The -
effects -
on -
renal -
function -
on -
two -
different -
immunosuppressive -
protocols -
were -
evaluated -
retrospectively -
in -
two -
subsequent -
groups -
of -
heart -
transplant -
recipients -
. -

In -
group -
I -
, -
cyclosporine D016572
was -
given -
before -
the -
procedure -
at -
a -
loading -
dose -
of -
17 -
. -
5 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
and -
then -
continued -
after -
the -
procedure -
to -
keep -
a -
whole -
blood -
level -
about -
1000 -
ng -
/ -
ml -
. -

In -
group -
II -
, -
cyclosporine D016572
was -
started -
only -
after -
the -
procedure -
at -
a -
lower -
dosage -
and -
was -
complemented -
by -
azathioprine D001379
, -
which -
was -
used -
for -
the -
first -
postoperative -
week -
. -

Group -
II -
showed -
a -
better -
perioperative -
renal -
function -
as -
determined -
by -
serum -
blood -
urea D001806
nitrogen -
and -
serum -
creatinine D003404
levels -
. -

Group -
II -
also -
showed -
a -
significant -
decrease -
of -
chronic -
nephrotoxicity -
secondary -
to -
long -
- -
term -
therapy -
with -
cyclosporine D016572
. -

Despite -
this -
improvement -
in -
late -
renal -
function -
, -
group -
II -
still -
shows -
a -
slow -
rise -
in -
serum -
creatinine D003404
. -

We -
think -
that -
even -
these -
lower -
dosages -
of -
cyclosporine D016572
can -
cause -
chronic -
nephrotoxicity -
and -
that -
further -
modification -
of -
the -
immunosuppressive -
regimen -
is -
required -
to -
completely -
abolish -
this -
toxic -
side -
effect -

67 -

patient -
, -
with -
primary -
polymyositis -
and -
without -

evidence -
of -

disease -
, -
developed -
clinical -
and -
biochemical -
features -
of -
severe -
cholestasis -
3 -
months -
after -
initiation -
of -
azathioprine D001379
therapy -
. -

Liver -
biopsy -
showed -
cholestasis -
with -
both -
cytological -
and -
architectural -
alterations -
of -
interlobular -
bile -

Azathioprine D001379
withdrawal -
resulted -
after -
7 -
weeks -
in -
the -
resolution -
of -
clinical -
and -

It -
is -
believed -
that -
this -
is -
the -
first -
reported -
case -
of -
reversible -
azathioprine D001379

The -
effect -
of -
isoflurane D007530
- -
induced -
hypotension -
on -
glomerular -
function -
and -
renal -
blood -
flow -
was -
investigated -
in -
20 -
human -
subjects -
. -

Glomerular -
filtration -
rate -
( -

Anesthesia -
was -
maintained -

pressure -
of -
59 -

8 -
+ -
/ -
- -
0 -
. -

mmHg -
. -

GFR -
and -
ERPF -
decreased -
with -
the -
induction -
of -
anesthesia -
but -
not -
significantly -
more -
during -
hypotension -
. -

Postoperatively -
, -
ERPF -
returned -
to -
preoperative -
values -
, -
whereas -
GFR -
was -
higher -
than -
preoperative -
values -
. -

Renal -
vascular -
resistance -
increased -
during -
anesthesia -
but -
decreased -
when -
hypotension -
was -
induced -
, -
allowing -
the -
maintenance -
of -
renal -
blood -
flow -
. -

We -
conclude -
that -
renal -
compensatory -
mechanisms -
are -
preserved -
during -
isoflurane D007530
- -
induced -
hypotension -
and -
that -
renal -
function -
and -

quickly -
return -

Cefotetan D015313

. -

Immune -
hemolytic -
anemia -
due -
to -
a -
drug -
- -
adsorption -
mechanism -
has -
been -
described -
primarily -
in -
patients -
receiving -
penicillins D010406
and -
first -
- -
generation -
cephalosporins D002511
. -

We -
describe -
a -
patient -
who -
developed -
anemia -
while -
receiving -
intravenous -
cefotetan D015313
. -

Cefotetan D015313
- -
dependent -
antibodies -
were -
detected -
in -
the -
patient -
' -
s -
serum -
and -
in -
an -
eluate -
prepared -
from -
his -
red -
blood -
cells -
. -

The -
eluate -
also -
reacted -
weakly -
with -
red -
blood -
cells -
in -
the -
absence -
of -
cefotetan D015313
, -
suggesting -
the -
concomitant -
formation -
of -
warm -
- -
reactive -
autoantibodies -
. -

These -
observations -
, -
in -
conjunction -
with -
clinical -
and -
laboratory -
evidence -
of -
extravascular -
hemolysis -
, -
are -
consistent -
with -
drug -
- -
induced -
hemolytic -
anemia -
, -
possibly -
involving -
both -
drug -
- -
adsorption -
and -
autoantibody -
formation -
mechanisms -
. -

This -
case -
emphasizes -
the -
need -
for -
increased -
awareness -
of -
hemolytic -
reactions -
to -
all -
cephalosporins D002511

up -
of -
six -
cases -
of -
acute -
renal -
failure -
that -
have -
been -
reported -
earlier -
. -

The -
patients -
had -
developed -
transient -
renal -
failure -
after -
the -
intermittent -
administration -
of -
rifampicin D012293
. -

The -
stage -
of -
olig -

anuria -
lasted -
for -
1 -
- -
3 -
weeks -
, -
and -
five -
of -
the -
patients -
were -
treated -
by -
hemodialysis -
. -

Two -
of -
the -
patients -
died -
due -
to -
unrelated -
causes -
during -
the -
follow -
- -
up -
period -
. -

The -
four -
patients -

- -
examined -
were -
clinically -
cured -
. -

Pathologic -
findings -
by -

Nothing -

Although -
in -
the -
acute -

appeared -
toxic -
, -
evidence -

Toxicities -
included -
hepatotoxicity -
, -
malaise -
, -
and -
dose -
- -
limiting -
nephrotoxicity -
. -

This -
latter -
effect -
is -
thought -
to -
be -
due -
to -
drug -
precipitation -
within -
the -

as -
a -
result -
of -
the -

to -

problem -
, -
a -
clinical -
trial -
of -
CB C031662
3717 -
administered -
with -

is -
under -
way -
. -

Preliminary -
results -
at -

suggest -
that -
a -
reduction -
in -

may -
have -
been -
achieved -
with -
only -
1 -
instance -
of -

does -
not -

Ethopropazine C084820

. -

In -
a -
12 -
- -

controlled -
study -
ethopropazine C084820
was -
compared -
to -
benztropine D001590
in -
the -
treatment -
of -

induced -
by -

in -
60 -

Ethopropazine C084820
and -

were -
found -
to -
be -
equally -
effective -
in -
controlling -
parkinsonian -
symptoms -
and -
were -
as -
efficacious -
as -
procyclidine D011352
, -
their -
previous -
antiparkinsonian -
drug -
. -

However -
, -
benztropine D001590
treated -
patients -
had -
a -
significant -
increase -
in -
tardive -
dyskinesia -
compared -
to -
their -
condition -
during -

, -
and -
significantly -
more -
anxiety -
and -
depression -
than -

. -

This -
suggests -
that -
benztropine D001590
is -
not -
the -
anticholinergic -
drug -
of -
choice -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -

Lometrexol C045894
is -
an -
antifolate -
which -
inhibits -
glycinamide C402896
ribonucleotide -

Extensive -

that -
lometrexol C045894
has -
activity -
against -
tumours -
which -
are -
refractory -
to -
other -
drugs -
, -
notably -
methotrexate D008727
. -

However -
, -
the -
initial -
clinical -
development -
of -
lometrexol C045894
was -
curtailed -
because -
of -
severe -
and -
cumulative -
antiproliferative -
toxicities -
. -

Preclinical -
murine -
studies -
demonstrated -
that -
the -
toxicity -

that -
the -
toxicity -
of -

can -
be -
markedly -

by -
folic D005492

Thrombocytopenia -

were -
the -
major -
toxicities -

There -
was -
no -
clear -
relationship -
between -
clinical -
toxicity -

were -
not -
altered -
by -

BACKGROUND -
: -
In -
recent -
studies -
increased -
amounts -
of -
nitric D009569
oxide -
( -
NO D009569
) -
and -
apoptosis -
have -
been -
implicated -
in -
various -
pathological -
conditions -
in -
the -
kidney -
. -

We -
have -
studied -
the -
role -
of -
NO D009569
and -
its -
association -
with -
apoptosis -
in -
an -
experimental -
model -
of -
nephrotic -
syndrome -
induced -
by -
a -
single -
injection -
of -
adriamycin D004317
( -
ADR D004317
) -
. -

METHODS -
: -
The -
alteration -
in -
the -
NO D009569
pathway -
was -
assessed -
by -
measuring -
nitrite D009573
levels -
in -
serum -
/ -
urine -
and -
by -
evaluating -
the -
changes -
in -
vascular -
reactivity -
of -
the -
isolated -
perfused -
rat -
kidney -
( -
IPRK -
) -
system -
. -

Rats -
were -
stratified -
into -
control -
groups -
and -
ADR D004317
- -
induced -
nephropathy -
groups -
. -

These -
two -
groups -
were -
then -
divided -
into -
: -
group -
1 -
, -
animals -
receiving -
saline -
; -
and -
group -
2 -
, -
animals -
receiving -
aminoguanidine C004479
( -
AG C004479
) -
which -
is -
a -
specific -
inhibitor -
of -
inducible -
- -
NO D009569
synthase -
. -

On -
day -
21 -
, -
rats -
were -
sacrificed -
after -
obtaining -
material -
for -
biochemical -
analysis -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Histopathological -
examination -
of -
the -
kidneys -
of -
rats -
treated -
with -
ADR D004317
revealed -
focal -
areas -
of -
mesangial -
proliferation -
and -
mild -
tubulointerstitial -
inflammation -
. -

They -
also -
had -
significantly -
higher -
levels -
of -
proteinuria -
compared -
with -
control -
and -
treatment -
groups -
( -
P -
< -
0 -
. -
05 -
) -
. -

Urine -
nitrite D009573
levels -
were -
significantly -
increased -
in -
the -
ADR D004317
- -
nephropathy -
group -
( -
P -
< -
0 -
. -
05 -
) -
. -

In -
the -
IPRK -
phenylephrine D010656
and -
acetylcholine D000109
related -
responses -
were -
significantly -
impaired -
in -
the -
ADR D004317
- -
nephropathy -
group -
. -

Apoptosis -
was -
not -
detected -
in -
controls -
. -

However -
, -
in -
the -
ADR D004317
- -
nephropathy -
group -
, -
numerous -
apoptotic -
cells -
were -
identified -
in -
the -
tubulointerstitial -
areas -
. -

Double -
staining -
revealed -
numerous -
interstitial -
apoptotic -
cells -
to -
stain -
for -
ED1 -
, -
a -
marker -
for -
monocytes -
/ -
macrophages -
. -

Treatment -
with -
AG C004479
prevented -
the -
impairment -
of -
renal -
vascular -
bed -
responses -
and -
reduced -
both -
urine -
nitrite D009573
levels -
and -
apoptosis -
to -
control -
levels -
. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
We -
suggest -
that -
interactions -
between -
NO D009569
and -
apoptosis -
are -
important -
in -
the -
pathogenesis -
of -
the -
ADR D004317

induced -
nephrosis -

It -
is -
known -
that -
beta -
- -
adrenoceptor -
antagonists -
are -
effective -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
akathisia -
, -
one -
of -
the -
extrapyramidal -
side -

that -
occur -
during -

Neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
catalepsy -
, -
a -
model -
of -
neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
extrapyramidal -
side -
effects -
, -
was -
considered -
suitable -
as -
a -
model -
for -
predicting -
neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
akathisia -
in -
humans -
, -
although -
neuroleptic -
- -

was -
not -
considered -
a -
specific -
test -
for -

. -

Therefore -
, -
the -
effects -
of -
carteolol D002354
, -
a -
beta -
- -
adrenoceptor -
antagonist -
, -
on -
haloperidol D006220
- -

were -
behaviorally -
studied -
and -

with -
those -
of -
propranolol D011433
and -
biperiden D001712
, -
a -
muscarinic -
receptor -
antagonist -
. -

Carteolol D002354
, -
as -
well -
as -
propranolol D011433
and -
biperiden D001712
, -
inhibited -
the -
haloperidol D006220
- -
induced -
catalepsy -
. -

The -
inhibitory -
effect -
of -
carteolol D002354
was -
almost -
comparable -
to -
that -
of -
propranolol D011433
, -
but -
was -
weaker -
than -
that -
of -
biperiden D001712
. -

Carteolol D002354
did -
not -
evoke -
postsynaptic -
dopamine D004298
receptor -
- -
stimulating -
behavioral -
signs -
such -
as -
stereotypy -
and -
hyperlocomotion -
in -
rats -
. -

Carteolol D002354
did -
not -
antagonize -
the -
inhibitory -
effects -
of -
haloperidol D006220
on -
apomorphine D001058
- -
induced -
stereotypy -
and -
locomotor -
activity -
in -
rats -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
carteolol D002354
did -
not -
evoke -
5 -
- -
HT1A -
receptor -
- -
stimulating -
behavioral -
signs -
such -
as -
flat -
body -
posture -
and -
forepaw -
treading -
and -
did -
not -
inhibit -
5 D006916
- -
hydroxytryptophan -
- -
induced -
head -
twitch -
in -
rats -
. -

Finally -
, -
carteolol D002354
did -
not -
inhibit -
physostigmine D010830
- -
induced -
lethality -
in -
rats -
. -

These -
results -
strongly -
suggest -
that -
carteolol D002354
improves -
haloperidol D006220
- -
induced -
catalepsy -
via -
its -
beta -
- -
adrenoceptor -
antagonistic -
activity -
and -
is -
expected -
to -
be -
effective -
in -
the -
treatment -
of -
akathisia -
without -
attenuating -
neuroleptic -
- -
induced -
antipsychotic -
effects -
due -
to -
its -
postsynaptic -
dopamine D004298
receptor -
antagonistic -
activity -

extreme -
abnormalities -
seen -
in -
the -
entire -
group -

; -
some -
increased -

In -

the -

A -
43 -

treatment -
for -
another -
4 -
days -
after -
the -
appearance -
of -

Over -
the -

In -
rare -
cases -

the -
first -
few -
weeks -
of -
therapy -
, -
this -
drug -
can -
cause -
severe -

Physicians -
and -
patients -
should -
be -
aware -
of -
this -
adverse -
effect -

Ciprofloxacin D002939
has -
been -

side -
effects -
including -
interstitial -
nephritis -
and -
hemolytic -

The -
combination -
of -

In -

the -
serum -

We -
consider -
this -
episode -
of -
SIADH -
to -
be -
the -
result -
of -
a -
combination -
of -
factors -

, -
and -
the -
biochemical -
nature -
of -
these -

was -
investigated -
in -
two -
animal -

Enflurane D004737

resulted -
in -
neoantigens -
detected -
in -
both -

that -
were -
up -

fold -
greater -
in -

This -
supports -
and -
extends -
previous -
evidence -
for -
a -
mechanism -
by -
which -
enflurane D004737

isoflurane D007530
could -
produce -
a -

either -
alone -

a -
selective -
serotonin D012701

The -

examine -
the -
impact -
of -

was -

In -

Neither -
carboplatin D016190
nor -

When -
tumors -
were -

( -
60 -

) -
5 -
days -
after -
implantation -
, -
a -
growth -
delay -
with -
a -
subsequent -
regrowth -
of -
the -
tumors -
was -
observed -
. -

In -
the -
anemia -
group -
, -
the -
growth -
delay -
was -
significantly -
shorter -
compared -
with -
nonanemic -
controls -
( -
13 -
. -
3 -
days -
versus -
8 -

. -

In -
the -
group -
where -
anemia -
was -
prevented -
by -
rHuEPO -
treatment -
, -
growth -
delay -
was -
comparable -
with -
that -
of -
nonanemic -
controls -
( -
13 -
. -
3 -
days -
) -
. -

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
chemotherapy -
- -
induced -
anemia -
reduces -
cytotoxicity -
of -
cyclophosphamide D003520
in -
tumors -
, -
whereas -
correction -
of -

by -

A -

We -
have -

a -

some -

Forty -

Based -
on -
the -

from -
the -

, -
we -
suggest -
that -

: -
Experimental -

have -
revealed -
that -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Our -
results -
revealed -
that -
continuous -
high -

of -
the -

suppressed -
acute -

It -
is -
widely -
believed -
that -
dopamine D004298

mediates -
methamphetamine D008694
( -
METH D008694

- -
induced -
toxicity -
to -
brain -
dopaminergic -
neurons -
, -
because -
drugs -
that -
interfere -
with -
DA D004298
neurotransmission -
decrease -
toxicity -
, -
whereas -
drugs -
that -
increase -
DA D004298
neurotransmission -
enhance -
toxicity -
. -

However -
, -
temperature -
effects -
of -
drugs -
that -
have -
been -
used -
to -
manipulate -
brain -
DA D004298
neurotransmission -
confound -
interpretation -
of -
the -
data -
. -

Here -
we -
show -
that -
the -
recently -
reported -
ability -
of -
L D007980
- -
dihydroxyphenylalanine -
to -
reverse -
the -
protective -
effect -
of -

- -
methyl -
- -
para -
- -
tyrosine -
on -
METH D008694
- -
induced -
DA D004298
neurotoxicity -
is -
also -
confounded -
by -
drug -
effects -
on -
body -
temperature -
. -

Further -
, -
we -
show -
that -
mice -
genetically -
engineered -
to -
be -
deficient -
in -
brain -
DA D004298
develop -
METH D008694
neurotoxicity -
, -
as -
long -
as -
the -
thermic -
effects -
of -
METH D008694
are -
preserved -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
we -
demonstrate -
that -
mice -
genetically -
engineered -
to -
have -
unilateral -
brain -
DA D004298
deficits -
develop -
METH D008694
- -
induced -
dopaminergic -
deficits -
that -
are -
of -
comparable -
magnitude -
on -
both -
sides -
of -
the -
brain -
. -

Taken -
together -
, -
these -
findings -
demonstrate -
that -
DA D004298
is -
not -
essential -
for -
the -
development -
of -
METH D008694
- -
induced -
dopaminergic -

and -
suggest -
that -

. -

OBJECTIVE -
: -
Diabetic -
nephropathy -
is -
one -
of -
the -
major -
causes -
of -
renal -
failure -
, -
which -
is -
accompanied -
by -
the -
production -
of -
reactive -
oxygen D010100
species -
( -
ROS -
) -
. -

Nrf2 -
is -
the -
primary -
transcription -
factor -
that -
controls -
the -
antioxidant -
response -
essential -
for -
maintaining -
cellular -
redox -
homeostasis -
. -

Here -
, -
we -
report -
our -
findings -
demonstrating -
a -
protective -
role -
of -
Nrf2 -
against -
diabetic -
nephropathy -

RESEARCH -
DESIGN -
AND -
METHODS -
: -
We -
explore -
the -
protective -
role -
of -
Nrf2 -
against -
diabetic -
nephropathy -
using -
human -
kidney -
biopsy -
tissues -
from -
diabetic -
nephropathy -
patients -
, -
a -
streptozotocin D013311
- -
induced -
diabetic -
nephropathy -
model -
in -
Nrf2 -
( -
- -
/ -
- -
) -
mice -
, -
and -
cultured -
human -
mesangial -
cells -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
The -
glomeruli -
of -
human -
diabetic -
nephropathy -
patients -
were -
under -
oxidative -
stress -
and -
had -
elevated -
Nrf2 -
levels -
. -

In -
the -
animal -
study -
, -
Nrf2 -
was -
demonstrated -
to -
be -
crucial -
in -
ameliorating -
streptozotocin D013311
- -
induced -
renal -
damage -
. -

This -
is -
evident -
by -
Nrf2 -
( -
- -
/ -
- -
) -
mice -
having -
higher -
ROS -
production -
and -
suffering -
from -
greater -
oxidative -
DNA -
damage -
and -
renal -
injury -
compared -
with -
Nrf2 -
( -
+ -
/ -
+ -
) -
mice -
. -

Mechanistic -
studies -
in -
both -
in -
vivo -
and -
in -
vitro -
systems -
showed -
that -
the -
Nrf2 -
- -
mediated -
protection -
against -
diabetic -
nephropathy -
is -
, -
at -
least -
, -
partially -
through -
inhibition -
of -
transforming -
growth -
factor -
- -
beta1 -
( -
TGF -
- -
beta1 -
) -
and -
reduction -
of -
extracellular -
matrix -
production -
. -

In -
human -
renal -
mesangial -
cells -
, -
high -
glucose D005947
induced -
ROS -
production -
and -
activated -
expression -
of -
Nrf2 -
and -
its -
downstream -
genes -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
activation -
or -
overexpression -
of -
Nrf2 -
inhibited -
the -
promoter -
activity -
of -
TGF -
- -
beta1 -
in -
a -
dose -
- -
dependent -
manner -
, -
whereas -
knockdown -
of -
Nrf2 -
by -
siRNA -
enhanced -
TGF -
- -
beta1 -
transcription -
and -
fibronectin -
production -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
This -
work -
clearly -
indicates -
a -
protective -
role -
of -
Nrf2 -
in -
diabetic -
nephropathy -
, -
suggesting -
that -
dietary -
or -
therapeutic -
activation -
of -
Nrf2 -
could -
be -
used -
as -
a -
strategy -
to -
prevent -
or -
slow -
down -
the -
progression -
of -

BACKGROUND -
: -
In -
2 -
separate -
centers -
, -
we -
observed -
a -
notable -
increase -

3 -
% -
to -
3 -
. -
8 -
% -
in -
patients -
having -
undergone -
major -
cardiac -
surgical -
procedures -
. -

These -
events -
were -
temporally -
coincident -
with -
the -
initial -
use -
of -
high -

The -
purpose -
of -
this -
review -
was -
to -
perform -
a -
retrospective -

to -
examine -
whether -
there -
was -
a -
relation -
between -
TXA D014148

METHODS -
: -
An -
in -

was -
undertaken -
in -
all -
24 -
patients -
who -
developed -
perioperative -
seizures -
. -

Electroencephalographic -
activity -
was -
recorded -
in -
11 -
of -
these -
patients -
, -
and -
all -
patients -
had -
a -
formal -
neurological -
evaluation -

RESULTS -
: -
Twenty -
- -
one -
of -
the -
24 -
patients -
did -
not -
have -
evidence -
of -
new -
cerebral -
ischemic -
injury -
, -
but -
seizures -
were -
likely -
due -
to -
ischemic -
brain -
injury -
in -
3 -
patients -
. -

All -
patients -
with -
seizures -
did -
not -
have -
permanent -
neurological -

All -
24 -
patients -
with -
seizures -
received -
high -

, -
and -
21 -
of -
24 -
had -
undergone -
open -

All -
but -
one -
patient -
were -
managed -

The -

ranged -
from -

PURPOSE -
: -
Glucocorticoid -
administration -
can -
lead -
to -
the -
development -
of -

The -
purpose -
of -
this -
study -
was -
to -
determine -
whether -

can -
directly -
affect -
the -

METHODS -
: -
The -
anterior -

RESULTS -
: -
A -
significant -

in -
13 -
of -
the -
44 -
pairs -
of -

The -
contralateral -

, -
which -
did -
not -
receive -
dexamethasone D003907
, -
maintained -
a -
stable -
intraocular -
pressure -
during -
the -
same -
period -
. -

The -
outflow -
pathway -
of -
the -
untreated -

In -
contrast -
, -
the -
dexamethasone D003907

The -
dexamethasone D003907
- -
treated -
nonresponder -
eyes -
appeared -
to -
be -
morphologically -
similar -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Dexamethasone D003907
treatment -
of -
isolated -

perfusion -
- -
cultured -
human -
eyes -
led -
to -
the -

Urinary -

the -
extent -
of -

of -
the -
uncertainty -
about -

Hemolytic -

We -
describe -
a -
5th -

The -

may -
be -
mediated -

it -

It -
is -
important -
to -
recognize -
this -

when -
it -
occurs -
and -
to -
avoid -

Pyeloureteral -

anticoagulation -
: -
a -
case -
report -
. -

The -
etiology -
of -
pyeloureteritis -
cystica -
has -
long -
been -
attributed -
to -
chronic -
infection -
and -
inflammation -
. -

A -
case -
is -
presented -
that -
is -
unique -
in -
that -
the -
acute -
onset -
and -
the -
rapid -
resolution -
of -
pyeloureteral -
filling -
defects -
in -
this -
patient -
were -
documented -
by -
radiography -
. -

There -
is -
no -
evidence -
of -
antecedent -
or -
concurrent -
infection -
in -
this -
patient -
. -

The -
disease -
occurred -
subsequent -
to -
the -
initiation -
of -

therapy -
for -
suspected -
pelvic -
thrombophlebitis -
and -
cleared -
rapidly -
subsequent -
to -
its -
discontinuation -
. -

The -
rate -
of -
resolution -
of -
the -
radiographic -
findings -
may -
be -
helpful -
in -
distinguishing -
between -
true -
pyeloureteritis -

and -

Long -

Discontinuance -

A -

abrupt -
elevation -

We -
concluded -
that -

hepatotoxicity -
and -
believe -
that -
this -
is -
the -
first -
case -
reported -

This -
report -
also -
suggests -
that -

( -

) -
. -

To -
further -
our -
understanding -
of -
the -
mechanism -
of -
CS -1
cytoprotection -
, -
we -
examined -
in -
rats -
and -
mice -
the -
protective -
abilities -
of -

and -
the -
non -

hydrolyzable -

- -
, -

- -
and -
galactosamine D005688
- -
induced -

. -

The -
results -
of -
these -
studies -
demonstrated -
that -
CS -1
- -
mediated -
protection -
is -
not -
selective -
for -
a -
particular -
species -
, -
organ -
system -
or -
toxic -
chemical -
. -

A -
24 -

h -
pretreatment -
of -
both -
rats -
and -

with -
a -

CS -1
( -
100mg -

) -
, -

of -
CCl4 D002251
, -
CHCl3 D002725
, -
acetaminophen D000082
and -
galactosamine D005688
and -
against -
the -
lethal -
( -
and -
presumably -
cardiotoxic -
) -
effect -
of -
adriamycin D004317
administration -
. -

Maximal -
CS -1
- -
mediated -
protection -
was -
observed -
in -
experimental -
animals -
pretreated -
24 -
h -
prior -
to -
the -
toxic -
insult -
. -

These -
data -
suggest -
that -
CS -1
intervenes -
in -
a -
critical -
cellular -
event -
that -
is -
an -
important -
common -
pathway -
to -
toxic -
cell -
death -
. -

The -
mechanism -
of -
CS -1
protection -
does -
not -
appear -
to -
be -
dependent -
on -
the -
inhibition -
of -
chemical -
bioactivation -
to -
a -
toxic -
reactive -
intermediate -
( -
in -
light -
of -
the -
protection -
observed -
against -
galactosamine D005688
hepatotoxicity -
) -
. -

However -
, -
based -
on -
the -
data -
presented -
, -
we -
can -
not -
exclude -
the -
possibility -
that -
CS -1
administration -
inhibits -
chemical -
bioactivation -
. -

Our -
findings -
do -
suggest -
that -
CS -1
- -
mediated -
protection -
is -
dependent -
on -
the -
action -
of -
the -
intact -
anionic -
CS -1
molecule -
( -
non -
- -
hydrolyzable -
CSE -1
was -
as -
protective -
as -

whose -
mechanism -

RESULTS -
: -
Nontoxic -

, -
dexrazoxane D064730
neither -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Although -
our -
findings -
support -
the -
observation -
that -
dexrazoxane D064730
reduces -
neither -
hematologic -
activity -
nor -
antitumor -
activity -
from -
doxorubicin D004317
clinically -
, -
the -
potent -
antagonism -
of -
daunorubicin D003630
activity -
raises -
concern -
; -
a -
possible -
interference -
with -
anticancer -
efficacy -
certainly -
would -
call -
for -
renewed -
attention -
. -

Our -
data -
also -
suggest -
that -
significant -
etoposide D005047
dose -
escalation -
is -
perhaps -
possible -
by -
the -
use -
of -
dexrazoxane D064730

plays -
a -
causative -
role -
for -

The -
possible -
mechanisms -
are -

the -
use -

A -
prospective -
evaluation -
of -
the -
efficacy -

was -
conducted -
in -
54 -
consecutive -
patients -
over -
a -
16 -

Vancomycin D014640
was -
curative -
in -
95 -
% -
of -
43 -
patients -
with -
proven -
infection -
. -

Drugs -
were -
ceased -
in -
six -
patients -
because -
of -
adverse -
reactions -
; -
in -
three -
of -
these -
vancomycin D014640
was -
considered -
the -
likely -
cause -

Reactions -
included -
thrombophlebitis -
( -

) -
, -

and -
ototoxicity -
( -

Thrombophlebitis -
occurred -

were -
confined -

administered -
appropriately -

constitutes -
safe -

effective -
therapy -
for -

RATIONALE -
AND -
OBJECTIVES -
: -
The -
light -
- -
enhanced -
startle -
paradigm -

is -
suggested -
to -

In -
contrast -
, -
the -
fear -
- -
potentiated -

However -
, -
the -
pharmacological -
profiles -
of -
these -

paradigms -
are -
very -

The -
present -
study -
investigated -
the -
effects -
of -
putative -
anxiogenic -
drugs -
on -
LES -
and -
FPS -
and -
aimed -
at -
determining -
the -
sensitivity -
of -
LES -
for -
anxiogenic -
drugs -
and -
to -
potentially -
showing -
a -
pharmacological -

RESULTS -
: -
None -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
In -

, -
none -
of -

a -
clear -

The -
cardiac -

As -
phenytoin D010672

We -
present -
a -
15 -
- -
year -
- -
old -

schizophrenic -
who -
developed -
frequent -
involuntary -
eye -
- -
blinking -

after -
5 -
months -
of -
amisulpride C012052
treatment -
( -
1000 -

) -
. -

The -
tic -
- -

symptoms -
resolved -
completely -
after -
we -
reduced -
the -
dose -
of -

down -
to -
800 -
mg -
per -

. -

However -
, -
her -

recurred -
after -
the -

. -

We -
then -
placed -
her -
on -
an -
additional -
100 -
mg -

She -
has -
been -

No -

Together -
with -
previously -

, -
our -

suggests -
that -

might -
occur -

, -
and -
VSD -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
High -
concordance -
in -
major -
developmental -

However -
, -
the -
torsadogenic -
potential -
of -
metoclopramide D008787
, -
a -
commonly -
used -
antiemetic -
and -
prokinetic -
drug -
, -
has -
not -
been -
reported -
in -

despite -
its -
chemical -
similarity -
to -

We -
report -
on -
a -
92 -

who -
developed -
torsade -
de -
pointes -
after -
intravenous -
and -
oral -
administration -
of -
metoclopramide D008787

This -
patient -
also -
developed -
torsade -
de -
pointes -
when -
cisapride D020117
and -
erythromycin D004917
were -
given -
simultaneously -
. -

These -
two -
episodes -
were -
suppressed -
successfully -
after -
discontinuing -
the -
offending -
drugs -
and -
administering -
class -

This -
is -
the -
first -
documentation -
that -
metoclopramide D008787
provokes -
torsade -

Metoclopramide D008787

be -
used -

Apomorphine D001058
: -
an -
underutilized -
therapy -
for -
Parkinson -
' -
s -
disease -
. -

Apomorphine D001058
was -
the -
first -
dopaminergic -
drug -
ever -
used -
to -
treat -
symptoms -
of -
Parkinson -
' -
s -
disease -
. -

While -
powerful -
antiparkinsonian -
effects -
had -
been -
observed -
as -
early -
as -
1951 -
, -
the -
potential -
of -
treating -
fluctuating -
Parkinson -
' -
s -
disease -
by -
subcutaneous -
administration -
of -
apomorphine D001058
has -
only -
recently -
become -
the -
subject -
of -
systematic -
study -
. -

A -
number -
of -
small -
scale -
clinical -
trials -
have -
unequivocally -
shown -
that -
intermittent -
subcutaneous -
apomorphine D001058
injections -
produce -
antiparkinsonian -
benefit -
close -
if -
not -
identical -
to -
that -
seen -
with -
levodopa D007980
and -
that -
apomorphine D001058
rescue -
injections -
can -
reliably -
revert -
off -
- -
periods -
even -
in -
patients -
with -
complex -
on -
- -
off -
motor -
swings -
. -

Continuous -
subcutaneous -
apomorphine D001058
infusions -
can -
reduce -
daily -
off -
- -
time -
by -
more -
than -
50 -
% -
in -
this -
group -
of -
patients -
, -
which -
appears -
to -
be -
a -
stronger -
effect -
than -
that -
generally -
seen -
with -
add -
- -
on -
therapy -
with -
oral -
dopamine D004298
agonists -
or -
COMT -
inhibitors -
. -

Extended -
follow -
- -
up -
studies -
of -
up -
to -
8 -
years -
have -
demonstrated -
long -
- -
term -
persistence -
of -
apomorphine D001058
efficacy -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
there -
is -
convincing -
clinical -
evidence -
that -
monotherapy -
with -
continuous -
subcutaneous -
apomorphine D001058
infusions -
is -
associated -
with -
marked -
reductions -
of -
preexisting -
levodopa D007980
- -
induced -
dyskinesias -
. -

The -
main -
side -
effects -
of -
subcutaneous -
apomorphine D001058
treatment -
are -
related -
to -
cutaneous -
tolerability -
problems -
, -
whereas -
sedation -
and -
psychiatric -
complications -
play -
a -
lesser -
role -
. -

Given -
the -
marked -
degree -
of -
efficacy -
of -
subcutaneous -
apomorphine D001058
treatment -
in -
fluctuating -
Parkinson -

this -
approach -
seems -
to -
deserve -
more -

Compared -
with -
controls -
, -
EDDs -
were -
more -
frequently -
black -

They -
were -
less -

RESULTS -
: -
Urinary -

Notably -
, -
this -
side -

origin -
. -

A -
common -
side -
effect -
associated -
with -
succinylcholine D013390
is -
postoperative -
myalgia -
. -

The -
pathogenesis -
of -
this -
myalgia -
is -
still -
unclear -
; -
inflammation -
has -
been -
suggested -
but -
without -
convincing -
evidence -
. -

We -
designed -
the -
present -
study -
to -
investigate -
whether -
an -
inflammatory -
reaction -
contributes -
to -
this -
myalgia -
. -

The -
incidence -
and -
severity -
of -
succinylcholine D013390
- -
associated -
myalgia -
was -
determined -
in -
64 -
patients -
pretreated -
with -

or -
dexamethasone D003907
before -
succinylcholine D013390
( -
n -
= -
32 -
for -
each -
) -
. -

Incidence -
and -
severity -
of -
myalgia -
did -
not -
differ -
significantly -
between -
the -
two -
groups -
: -
15 -
patients -
in -
the -
dexamethasone D003907
group -
complained -
of -
myalgia -
compared -
with -
18 -
patients -
in -
the -
saline -
group -
, -
and -
severe -
myalgia -
was -
reported -
by -
five -
patients -
and -
three -
patients -
, -
respectively -
( -
not -
significant -
) -
. -

At -
48 -
h -
after -
surgery -
, -
12 -
patients -
in -
both -
groups -
still -
suffered -
from -
myalgia -
( -
not -

) -
. -

In -
addition -
, -
interleukin -
- -
6 -
( -
IL -
- -
6 -
) -
as -
an -
early -
marker -
of -
inflammation -
was -
assessed -
in -
a -
subgroup -
of -
10 -
patients -
pretreated -
with -
saline -
. -

We -
found -
an -
increase -
of -
IL -
- -
6 -
for -
only -
three -
patients -
, -
but -
only -
one -
patient -
reported -
myalgia -
; -
no -
relationship -
between -
myalgia -
and -
the -
increase -
of -
IL -
- -
6 -
was -
found -
. -

In -
conclusion -
, -
there -
is -
no -
evidence -
for -
an -
inflammatory -
origin -
of -
succinylcholine D013390
- -
associated -
myalgia -
. -

IMPLICATIONS -
: -
Administration -
of -
dexamethasone D003907
before -
succinylcholine D013390
was -
not -
effective -
in -
decreasing -
the -
incidence -
or -
the -
severity -
of -
succinylcholine D013390
- -
induced -
postoperative -
myalgia -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
there -
was -
no -
significant -
relationship -
between -
postoperative -
myalgia -
and -
time -
course -
of -
interleukin -
- -
6 -
concentrations -
, -
a -
marker -

Pretreatment -
with -

Pregnenolone C018370
sulphate -
( -

has -
generated -
interest -
as -
one -
of -
the -
most -

to -
be -
examined -
in -

The -
mechanism -
by -
which -
this -

is -
hypothesized -
to -
involve -
actions -
on -
glutamatergic -

All -
patients -
having -

SUMMARY -
: -
A -
68 -

old -
white -
woman -
with -
Candida -
glabrata -
isolated -
from -
a -
presacral -
abscess -
developed -
TDP -
eight -
days -
after -
commencing -
oral -
fluconazole D015725
The -
patient -
had -
no -

risk -
factors -
for -
TDP -
, -
including -
coronary -
artery -
disease -
, -
cardiomyopathy -
, -
congestive -
heart -
failure -
, -
and -
electrolyte -
abnormalities -
There -
was -
a -
temporal -
association -
between -
the -
initiation -
of -
fluconazole D015725
and -
TDP -
. -

The -
TDP -
resolved -
when -
fluconazole D015725

discontinued -
; -
however -
, -
the -
patient -
continued -
to -
have -
premature -
ventricular -
contractions -
and -
nonsustained -
ventricular -
tachycardia -
( -
NSVT -
) -
until -
six -
days -
after -
drug -
cessation -
DISCUSSION -
: -
Use -
of -
the -
Naranjo -
probability -
scale -
indicates -
a -
probable -
relationship -
between -
the -
use -
of -
fluconazole D015725
and -
the -
development -
of -
TDP -
. -

The -
possible -
mechanism -
is -
depression -
of -
rapidly -
activating -
delayed -
rectifier -
potassium D011188
currents -
. -

In -
our -
patient -
, -
there -
was -
no -
other -
etiology -
identified -
that -
could -
explain -
QT -
prolongation -
or -
TDP -
The -
complete -
disappearance -
of -
NSVT -
and -
premature -
ventricular -
contractions -
followed -
by -
normalization -
of -
QT -
interval -
after -
the -
drug -
was -
stopped -
strongly -
suggests -
fluconazole D015725
as -
the -
etiology -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Clinicians -
should -
be -
aware -
that -
fluconazole D015725
, -
even -
at -
low -
doses -
, -
may -
cause -
prolongation -
of -
the -
QT -
interval -
, -
leading -
to -
TDP -
. -

Serial -
electrocardiographic -
monitoring -
may -
be -
considered -
when -
fluconazole D015725
is -
administered -
in -
patients -
who -
are -
at -
risk -
for -
ventricular -
arrhythmias -

High -

Because -
of -
the -
National -
Acute -

Studies -
( -

, -
high -

dose -
methylprednisolone D008775
became -
the -
standard -
of -

for -
the -
acute -
spinal -

. -

In -
the -
NASCIS -
, -
there -
was -
no -
mention -
regarding -
the -
possibility -
of -
acute -
corticosteroid D000305
myopathy -
that -
high -
- -

may -
cause -
. -

The -
dosage -
of -
methylprednisolone D008775
recommended -
by -
the -
NASCIS -
3 -
is -
the -
highest -
dose -
of -
steroids D013256
ever -
being -
used -
during -
a -
2 -
- -
day -
period -
for -
any -
clinical -
condition -
. -

We -
hypothesize -
that -
it -
may -
cause -
some -
damage -
to -
the -
muscle -
of -
spinal -
cord -
injury -
patients -
. -

Further -
, -
steroid D013256
myopathy -
recovers -
naturally -
and -
the -
neurological -
improvement -
shown -
in -
the -
NASCIS -
may -
be -
just -
a -
recording -
of -
this -
natural -
motor -
recovery -
from -
the -
steroid D013256
myopathy -
, -
instead -
of -
any -
protection -
that -
methylprednisolone D008775
offers -
to -
the -
spinal -
cord -
injury -
. -

To -
our -
knowledge -
, -
this -
is -
the -
first -
discussion -
considering -
the -
possibility -
that -
the -
methylprednisolone D008775
recommended -

RESULTS -
: -
Impairment -
of -
cognitive -

was -
observed -
6 -
to -
8 -
hours -
after -
administration -
of -
haloperidol D006220
on -
Day -

haloperidol D006220
was -
given -
again -
25 -
days -
later -
, -
greater -
impairment -

onset -
was -
noted -
in -
several -
tests -
in -
both -
treatment -
groups -
, -
suggesting -
enhancement -
of -
this -
effect -

There -
was -
no -
indication -
that -
sertraline D020280
exacerbated -
the -
impairment -
produced -
by -
haloperidol D006220
since -
an -
equivalent -
effect -
also -
occurred -
in -
the -
placebo -
group -

Three -
subjects -
( -

) -
withdrew -
from -
the -

because -
of -
side -
effects -
. -

Ten -
subjects -
in -
each -

The -
side -
effect -
profiles -
of -
sertraline D020280
and -
of -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Haloperidol D006220
produced -
a -

that -
was -
not -
worsened -

in -
the -

- -
treated -
group -
consisted -

. -

However -
, -
epinephrine D004837
treatment -
resulted -
in -
the -
incorporation -
of -
epinephrine D004837
into -
renal -
catecholamine D002395
stores -
such -
that -
approximately -
40 -
% -
of -
the -
catecholamine D002395
present -
was -
epinephrine D004837
while -
the -
norepinephrine D009638
content -
was -
reduced -
by -
a -
similar -
degree -
. -

Total -
tissue -
catecholamine D002395
content -
of -
the -
kidney -
on -
a -
molar -
basis -
was -
unchanged -

Stimulus -
- -
induced -
fractional -
overflow -
of -
neurotransmitter -
from -
the -
epinephrine D004837
- -
treated -
kidneys -
was -
approximately -
twice -
normal -
and -
consisted -
of -
both -
norepinephrine D009638
and -
epinephrine D004837
in -
proportions -
similar -
to -
those -
found -
in -
the -
kidney -
. -

This -
difference -
in -
fractional -
overflow -
between -
groups -
was -
not -
affected -
by -
neuronal -

extraneuronal -
uptake -

Propranolol D011433
had -
no -
effect -

Phentolamine D010646
increased -
stimulus -
- -

in -
both -
groups -
although -
the -
increment -
in -
overflow -
was -
greater -
in -
the -
epinephrine D004837
- -
treated -
group -
. -

In -
conclusion -
, -
chronic -
epinephrine D004837
treatment -
results -
in -
enhanced -
fractional -
neurotransmitter -
overflow -
. -

However -
, -
neither -
alterations -
in -
prejunctional -

adrenoceptor -
influences -
nor -
alterations -
in -
neuronal -
and -

mechanisms -
appear -
to -
be -
responsible -
for -
this -
alteration -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
data -
obtained -
with -
phentolamine D010646
alone -
do -
not -
suggest -
alpha -
- -
adrenoceptor -
desensitization -
as -
the -
cause -
of -
the -
enhanced -
neurotransmitter -
overflow -

We -
followed -
210 -
cases -
of -
juvenile -
rheumatoid -
arthritis -
closely -
for -
eleven -
years -
. -

Thirty -
- -
six -
of -
the -
210 -
patients -
( -
17 -
. -
2 -
% -
) -
developed -
iridocyclitis -
. -

Iridocyclitis -
was -
seen -
most -
frequently -
in -
young -
female -
patients -
( -
0 -
to -
4 -
years -
) -
with -
the -
monoarticular -
or -
pauciatricular -
form -
of -
the -
arthritis -
. -

However -
, -
30 -
% -
of -
the -
patients -
developed -
uveitis -
after -
16 -
years -
of -
age -
. -

Although -
61 -
% -
of -
patients -
had -
a -
noncontributory -
ocular -
history -
on -
entry -
, -
42 -
% -
had -
active -
uveitis -
on -
entry -
. -

Our -
approach -
was -
effective -
in -
detecting -
uveitis -
in -
new -
cases -
and -
exacerbations -
of -
uveitis -
in -
established -
cases -
. -

Forty -
- -
four -
percent -
of -
patients -
with -
uveitis -
had -
one -
or -
more -
identifiable -
signs -
or -
symptoms -
, -
such -
as -
red -
eye -
, -
ocular -
pain -
, -
decreased -
visual -
acuity -
, -
or -
photophobia -
, -
in -
order -
of -
decreasing -
frequency -
. -

Even -
after -
early -
detection -
and -
prompt -
treatment -
, -
41 -
% -
of -
cases -
of -
uveitis -
did -
not -
respond -
to -
more -
than -
six -
months -
of -
intensive -
topical -
treatment -
with -
corticosteroids D000305
and -
mydriatics -
. -

Despite -
this -
, -
there -
was -
a -
dramatic -
decrease -
in -

occurred -
in -
only -
22 -
and -
13 -

We -
used -
chloroquine D002738
or -
hydroxychloroquine D006886
in -
173 -
of -
210 -
cases -
and -
found -
only -
one -
case -
of -
chorioretinopathy -
attributable -
to -
these -
drugs -
. -

Systemically -
administered -
corticosteroids D000305
were -
used -
in -
75 -
of -
210 -
cases -
; -
a -
significant -
number -
of -
posterior -
subcapsular -
cataracts -
was -
found -

developed -
in -
three -
of -
the -

Four -
cases -
of -
water -
intoxication -
in -
connection -
with -
oxytocin D010121
administration -
during -
saline -
- -
induced -
abortions -
are -
described -
. -

The -
mechanism -
of -
water -
intoxication -
is -
discussed -
in -
regard -
to -
these -
cases -
. -

Oxytocin D010121
administration -
during -
midtrimester -
- -
induced -
abortions -
is -
advocated -
only -
if -
it -
can -
be -
carried -
out -
under -
careful -
observations -
of -
an -
alert -
nursing -
staff -
, -
aware -
of -
the -
symptoms -
of -
water -
intoxication -
and -
instructed -
to -
watch -
the -
diuresis -
and -
report -
such -
early -
signs -
of -
the -
syndrome -
as -
asthenia -
, -
muscular -
irritability -
, -
or -
headaches -
. -

The -
oxytocin D010121
should -
be -
given -
only -
in -
Ringers -
lactate D019344
or -
, -
alternately -
, -
in -
Ringers -
lactate D019344
and -
a -
5 -
per -
cent -
dextrose D005947
and -
water -
solutions -
. -

The -
urinary -
output -
should -
be -
monitored -
and -
the -
oxytocin D010121
administration -
discontinued -
and -
the -
serum -
electrolytes -
checked -
if -
the -
urinary -
output -
decreases -
. -

The -
oxytocin D010121
should -
not -
be -
administered -
in -
excess -
of -
36 -
hours -
. -

If -
the -
patient -
has -
not -
aborted -
by -
then -
the -
oxytocin D010121
should -
be -
discontinued -
for -
10 -
to -
12 -
hours -
in -
order -
to -
perform -
electrolyte -
determinations -
and -
correct -
any -
electrolyte -
imbalance -
