Fusidic -

those -
of -

Because -
of -
the -
need -
for -
the -
development -
of -
new -
treatments -
for -
Crohn -
' -
s -
disease -
, -
a -

the -

of -
fusidic D005672

Eight -
Crohn -

d -
. -
s -
. -
and -
the -
treatment -
was -
planned -
to -
last -
8 -
weeks -

The -
disease -

was -
primarily -
measured -
by -
a -

treatment -
: -
3 -
at -
two -
weeks -

. -

There -
were -
no -
serious -
clinical -
side -

, -
but -
dose -

was -
required -
in -
two -

Biochemically -
, -
an -
increase -

noted -
in -
5 -
of -
8 -
cases -

and -
the -
greatest -
increases -
were -
seen -
in -

to -

All -
reversed -

pre -
- -
treatment -
levels -
after -
cessation -
of -

The -
results -
of -
this -

suggest -
that -
fusidic D005672

may -
be -
of -
benefit -
in -
selected -
chronic -
active -
Crohn -

s -
disease -
patients -
in -
whom -

Because -
there -
seems -
to -
exist -
a -
scientific -
rationale -
for -
the -
use -
of -
fusidic D005672
acid -
at -
the -
cytokine -
level -
in -
inflammatory -

disease -
, -
we -
suggest -
that -
the -
role -
of -
this -
treatment -
should -
be -
further -
investigated -

Twenty -
common -
migraine -
patients -
received -
a -
one -
sided -
frontotemporal -
application -
of -
nitroglycerin D005996
( -
10 -
patients -
) -
or -
placebo -
ointment -
( -
10 -
patients -
) -
in -
a -
double -
blind -
study -
. -

Early -
onset -
migraine -
attacks -
were -
induced -
by -
nitroglycerin D005996
in -
seven -
out -
of -
10 -
patients -
versus -
no -
patient -
in -
the -
placebo -
group -
. -

Subsequently -
20 -
migraine -
patients -
, -
who -
developed -
an -
early -
onset -
attack -
with -
frontotemporal -
nitroglycerin D005996
, -
received -
the -
drug -
in -
a -
second -
induction -
test -
at -
other -
body -
areas -
. -

No -
early -
onset -
migraine -
was -
observed -
. -

Thus -
the -
migraine -
- -
inducing -
effect -
of -
nitroglycerin D005996
seems -
to -
depend -
on -
direct -
stimulation -
of -
the -
habitual -
site -
of -
pain -
, -
suggesting -
that -
the -
frontotemporal -
region -
is -
of -
crucial -
importance -
in -
the -
development -
of -
a -
migraine -
crisis -

This -
is -
not -
consistent -
with -
a -
CNS -
origin -

Clotiazepam C084599
- -
induced -
acute -
hepatitis -
. -

We -
report -
the -
case -
of -
a -
patient -
who -
developed -
acute -
hepatitis -
with -
extensive -
hepatocellular -
necrosis -
, -
7 -
months -
after -
the -
onset -
of -
administration -
of -
clotiazepam C084599
, -
a -
thienodiazepine C013295
derivative -
. -

Clotiazepam C084599
withdrawal -
was -
followed -
by -
prompt -
recovery -
. -

The -
administration -
of -
several -
benzodiazepines D001569
, -
chemically -
related -
to -
clotiazepam C084599
, -
did -
not -
interfere -
with -
recovery -
and -
did -
not -
induce -
any -
relapse -
of -
hepatitis -
. -

This -
observation -
shows -
that -
clotiazepam C084599
can -
induce -
acute -
hepatitis -
and -
suggests -
that -
there -
is -
no -
cross -
hepatotoxicity -
between -
clotiazepam C084599
and -
several -
benzodiazepines D001569

In -
both -

plasma -
aldosterone D000450
values -
were -
raised -

with -
a -
concomitant -

Our -
findings -
show -
that -
long -
- -
term -
treatment -
with -
high -
doses -

Induction -

tranexamic D014148
acid -
( -
AMCA D014148

in -
the -

rise -
to -

resembling -
that -
occurring -
after -

Injection -
of -
Captopril D002216
( -
1 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
) -
, -
an -
inhibitor -
of -
angiotensin D000809
converting -
enzyme -
( -
ACE -
) -
, -
reduced -
both -
pulmonary -
and -
renal -
insufficiency -
in -
this -
rat -
model -
. -

The -
lung -
weights -
were -
lower -
and -
PaO2 -
was -
improved -
in -
rats -
given -
this -
enzyme -
- -
blocking -
agent -
. -

The -
contents -
of -
albumin -
in -
the -
lungs -
were -
not -
changed -
, -
indicating -
that -
Captopril D002216
did -
not -
influence -
the -
extravasation -
of -
protein -
. -

Renal -
damage -
as -
reflected -
by -
an -
increase -
in -
serum -
urea D014508
and -
in -
kidney -
weight -
was -
prevented -
by -
Captopril D002216
. -

The -
amount -
of -
fibrin -
in -
the -
kidneys -
was -
also -
considerably -
lower -
than -
in -
animals -
which -
received -
thrombin -
and -
AMCA D014148
alone -
. -

It -
is -
suggested -
that -
the -
effects -
of -
Captopril D002216
on -
the -
lungs -
may -
be -
attributable -
to -
a -
vasodilatory -
effect -
due -
to -
a -
reduction -
in -
the -
circulating -
level -
of -
Angiotension D000804
II -
and -
an -
increase -
in -
prostacyclin D011464
( -
secondary -
to -
an -
increase -
in -
bradykinin D001920
) -
. -

Captopril D002216
may -
, -
by -
the -
same -
mechanism -
, -
reduce -
the -
increase -
in -
glomerular -
filtration -
that -
is -
known -
to -
occur -
after -
an -
injection -
of -
thrombin -
, -
thereby -
diminishing -
the -
aggregation -
of -
fibrin -
monomers -
in -
the -
glomeruli -
, -
with -
the -
result -
that -
less -
fibrin -
will -
be -
deposited -
and -
thus -
less -
kidney -
damage -
will -
be -
produced -

Formation -

Haloperidol D006220

the -
level -
in -
the -
AS -

remained -
considerably -
lower -

The -
results -
suggest -
that -
rigidity -

which -
is -
assumed -
to -
be -
due -
to -
an -
action -

can -
be -
antagonized -
by -

Nevertheless -
, -
there -
occurs -
some -

the -
signs -
of -
dopaminergic -
activation -
observed -
in -
the -
animals -

Adverse -
effects -
of -
antipsychotics -
often -
lead -
to -
noncompliance -
. -

Thus -
, -
clinicians -
should -
address -
patients -
' -
concerns -
about -
adverse -
effects -
and -
attempt -
to -
choose -
medications -
that -
will -
improve -
their -
patients -

quality -
of -
life -
as -
well -
as -
overall -
health -

The -
side -
effect -
profiles -
of -
the -
atypical -
antipsychotics -
are -
more -
advantageous -
than -
those -
of -
the -
conventional -
neuroleptics -
. -

Conventional -
agents -
are -
associated -
with -
unwanted -
central -

effects -
, -
including -
extrapyramidal -
symptoms -
( -
EPS -
) -
, -
tardive -
dyskinesia -
, -
sedation -

and -
possible -

The -
newer -
atypical -
agents -
have -
a -
lower -
risk -
of -
EPS -
, -
but -
are -
associated -
in -
varying -
degrees -
with -

Since -
the -
incidence -
and -
severity -
of -
specific -
adverse -
effects -
differ -
among -
the -
various -
atypicals -
, -
the -
clinician -
should -
carefully -
consider -
which -
side -

are -
most -
likely -
to -
lead -
to -
the -

Therefore -
the -
prophylactic -
use -
of -

should -
be -
considered -
with -
this -

The -
present -
studies -
demonstrate -
that -
growth -
and -
vitamin D014807
D -
treatment -
enhance -
the -
extent -
of -
artery -
calcification -
in -
rats -
given -
sufficient -

of -
Warfarin D014859
to -

The -

examined -
the -

of -

and -
growth -
status -
on -
artery -
calcification -
in -
Warfarin D014859
- -
treated -
rats -
. -

Treatment -
for -
2 -
weeks -
with -
Warfarin D014859
caused -
massive -

calcification -
of -
the -
artery -

in -
20 -

rats -
and -
less -

In -

, -
no -

could -
be -
detected -
in -

rats -
even -
after -

To -
directly -
examine -
the -
importance -
of -
growth -
to -
Warfarin D014859
- -
induced -
artery -
calcification -
in -
animals -
of -
the -
same -
age -
, -
20 -
- -
day -

rats -
were -
fed -
for -
2 -
weeks -
either -
an -

or -
a -
6 -
- -
g -
/ -
d -
restricted -
diet -
that -
maintains -
weight -
but -
prevents -
growth -
. -

Concurrent -
treatment -
of -
both -
dietary -
groups -
with -
Warfarin D014859
produced -
massive -
focal -
calcification -
of -
the -
artery -

in -
the -
ad -

- -
fed -
rats -
but -
no -
detectable -
artery -
calcification -
in -
the -
restricted -

diet -
, -
growth -
- -
inhibited -
group -
. -

Although -
the -
explanation -
for -
the -
association -
between -
artery -
calcification -
and -
growth -
status -
cannot -
be -
determined -
from -
the -
present -
study -
, -
there -
was -
a -
relationship -
between -
higher -
serum -
phosphate D010710
and -
susceptibility -
to -
artery -
calcification -
, -
with -
30 -
% -
higher -
levels -
of -
serum -
phosphate D010710
in -
young -
, -
ad -
libitum -
- -
fed -
rats -
compared -
with -
either -
of -
the -
groups -
that -
was -
resistant -
to -
Warfarin D014859
- -
induced -
artery -
calcification -
, -
ie -
, -
the -
10 -

month -
- -
old -
rats -
and -
the -
restricted -
- -
diet -
, -
growth -
- -
inhibited -
young -
rats -
. -

This -
observation -
suggests -
that -
increased -
susceptibility -
to -
Warfarin D014859
- -
induced -
artery -
calcification -
could -
be -
related -
to -
higher -
serum -
phosphate D010710
levels -
. -

The -
second -
set -
of -
experiments -
examined -
the -
possible -
synergy -
between -
vitamin D014807
D -
and -
Warfarin D014859
in -
artery -
calcification -
. -

High -
doses -
of -
vitamin D014807
D -
are -
known -
to -
cause -
calcification -
of -
the -
artery -
media -
in -
as -
little -
as -
3 -
to -
4 -
days -
. -

High -
doses -
of -
the -
vitamin D014812
K -
antagonist -
Warfarin D014859
are -
also -
known -
to -
cause -
calcification -
of -
the -
artery -
media -
, -
but -
at -
treatment -
times -
of -
2 -
weeks -
or -
longer -
yet -
not -
at -
1 -
week -
. -

In -
the -
current -
study -
, -
we -
investigated -
the -
synergy -
between -
these -
2 -
treatments -
and -
found -
that -
concurrent -
Warfarin D014859
administration -
dramatically -
increased -
the -
extent -
of -
calcification -
in -
the -
media -
of -
vitamin D014807
D -
- -
treated -
rats -
at -
3 -
and -
4 -
days -
. -

There -
was -
a -
close -
parallel -
between -
the -
effect -
of -
vitamin D014807
D -
dose -
on -
artery -
calcification -
and -
the -
effect -
of -
vitamin D014807
D -
dose -
on -
the -
elevation -
of -
serum -
calcium D002118
, -
which -
suggests -
that -
vitamin D014807
D -
may -
induce -
artery -
calcification -
through -
its -
effect -
on -
serum -
calcium D002118
. -

Because -
Warfarin D014859
treatment -
had -
no -
effect -
on -
the -
elevation -
in -
serum -
calcium D002118
produced -
by -
vitamin D014807
D -
, -
the -
synergy -
between -
Warfarin D014859
and -
vitamin D014807
D -
is -
probably -
best -
explained -
by -
the -
hypothesis -
that -
Warfarin D014859
inhibits -
the -
activity -
of -
matrix -
Gla -
protein -
as -
a -
calcification -
inhibitor -
. -

High -
levels -
of -
matrix -
Gla -
protein -
are -
found -
at -
sites -
of -
artery -
calcification -
in -
rats -
treated -
with -
vitamin D014807
D -
plus -
Warfarin D014859
, -
and -
chemical -
analysis -
showed -
that -
the -
protein -
that -
accumulated -
was -
indeed -
not -
gamma D015055
- -
carboxylated -
. -

These -
observations -
indicate -
that -
although -
the -
gamma D015055
- -
carboxyglutamate -
residues -
of -
matrix -
Gla -
protein -
are -
apparently -
required -
for -
its -
function -
as -
a -
calcification -
inhibitor -
, -
they -
are -
not -
required -
for -
its -
accumulation -
at -
calcification -
sites -

CASE -
SUMMARIES -
: -
Two -
patients -
developed -
prolonged -
cholestatic -
hepatitis -
after -
receiving -
ticlopidine D013988
following -
percutaneous -
coronary -
angioplasty -

the -
patients -
, -

DISCUSSION -
: -
Cholestatic -
hepatitis -
is -
a -
rare -
complication -
of -
the -
antiplatelet -
agent -
ticlopidine D013988
; -
several -
cases -
have -
been -
reported -
but -
few -
in -
the -
English -
literature -
. -

Our -
patients -
developed -
jaundice -
following -
treatment -
with -
ticlopidine D013988
and -
showed -
the -
clinical -
and -
laboratory -
characteristics -
of -
cholestatic -
hepatitis -
, -
which -
resolved -
after -
discontinuation -
of -
the -
drug -
. -

Hepatitis -
may -
develop -
weeks -
after -
discontinuation -
of -
the -
drug -
and -
may -
run -
a -
prolonged -
course -
, -
but -
complete -
remission -
was -
observed -
in -
all -
reported -
cases -
. -

An -
objective -
causality -
assessment -
revealed -
that -
the -
adverse -
drug -
event -
was -
probably -
related -
to -
the -
use -
of -
ticlopidine D013988
. -

The -
mechanisms -
of -
this -
ticlopidine D013988
- -
induced -
cholestasis -
are -
unclear -
. -

Immune -
mechanisms -
may -
be -
involved -
in -
the -
drug -
' -
s -
hepatotoxicity -
, -
as -
suggested -
by -
the -
T -
- -
cell -
stimulation -
study -
reported -
here -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Cholestatic -
hepatitis -
is -
a -
rare -
adverse -
effect -
of -
ticlopidine D013988
that -
may -
be -
immune -
mediated -
. -

Patients -
receiving -
the -
drug -
should -
be -
monitored -
with -
liver -
function -
tests -
along -
with -
complete -
blood -

counts -
. -

This -
complication -
will -
be -
observed -
even -
less -
often -
in -
the -
future -

ticlopidine D013988
is -

Using -

was -
1 -
, -
800 -

We -
found -
that -
( -
i -
) -

reduced -
the -

( -

gabapentin C040029
reduced -

suppressed -

this -
effect -
was -
more -
robust -
than -
the -
effect -
on -

The -
observed -
drug -
- -
induced -
effects -
were -
not -
due -
to -
changes -
in -
the -
baseline -
fMRI -
signal -

These -
findings -
indicate -
that -
gabapentin C040029
has -
a -
measurable -
antinociceptive -
effect -
and -
a -
stronger -
antihyperalgesic -
effect -
most -
evident -
in -
the -
brain -
areas -
undergoing -
deactivation -
, -
thus -
supporting -
the -
concept -
that -
gabapentin C040029
is -
more -
effective -
in -
modulating -
nociceptive -
transmission -
when -
central -

Thirty -

from -
the -

the -

noted -
tingling -

We -
conclude -
that -
careful -
screening -
for -

is -
recommended -
to -
help -
prevent -

BACKGROUND -
: -
The -
mechanisms -
underlying -
heart -

adriamycin D004317
are -
very -
complicated -
and -
still -
unclear -

The -
aim -
of -
this -
study -
was -
to -
investigate -
whether -
autophagy -
was -
involved -
in -
the -
progression -
of -
heart -
failure -
induced -
by -

, -
so -
that -
we -

RESULTS -
: -
3MA C025946
significantly -
improved -

Furthermore -
, -
adriamycin D004317
induced -
the -
formation -
of -
autophagic -
vacuoles -
, -
and -
3MA C025946
strongly -
downregulated -
the -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Autophagic -
cardiomyocyte -
death -
plays -
an -
important -
role -
in -
the -
pathogenesis -
of -
heart -
failure -
in -
rats -

OBJECTIVE -
: -
The -
globus -
pallidus -
plays -
a -
critical -
role -
in -
movement -
regulation -
. -

Previous -
studies -
have -
indicated -
that -
the -
globus -
pallidus -
receives -
neurotensinergic -
innervation -
from -
the -
striatum -
, -
and -
systemic -
administration -
of -
a -
neurotensin D009496
analog -
could -
produce -
antiparkinsonian -
effects -
. -

The -
present -
study -
aimed -
to -
investigate -
the -
effects -
of -
pallidal -
neurotensin D009496
on -
haloperidol D006220
- -
induced -
parkinsonian -
symptoms -
. -

METHODS -
: -
Behavioral -

were -
performed -
in -

globus -
pallidus -
reversed -
haloperidol D006220
- -
induced -

catalepsy -
in -
rats -
. -

Electrophysiological -
recordings -
showed -
that -
microinjection -
of -
neurotensin D009496
induced -
excitation -
of -
pallidal -
neurons -
in -
the -
presence -
of -
systemic -

blocked -
both -
the -
behavioral -
and -

. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Activation -
of -
pallidal -
neurotensin D009496

With -

the -

circumstantial -

and -
the -

remains -
speculative -

Although -
certain -
clinical -

the -
hypothesis -
that -
spasm -
involves -
the -
epicardial -

Diffuse -

is -
not -
consistent -
with -
reports -

Whereas -
certain -
in -

data -
suggest -
that -
these -
effects -
are -
alpha -

the -
opposite -

cocaine D003042
- -
induced -
vasoconstriction -
in -
segments -

suggests -
that -
the -

RESULTS -
: -
Four -
patients -
( -
1 -

were -
identified -
with -
toxic -

which -
could -
reasonably -
be -
attributed -
to -
the -

Persistent -

Reports -
of -
persistent -
paralysis -
after -
the -
discontinuance -
of -
these -

have -
most -
often -
involved -
aminosteroid -
- -
based -
NMBAs -

has -
also -
been -
associated -
with -

We -
report -
a -
case -
of -
atracurium D001279
- -
related -
paralysis -
persisting -
for -
approximately -
50 -
hours -
in -
a -

Habitual -
use -
of -
acetaminophen D000082
as -
a -
risk -
factor -
for -
chronic -
renal -
failure -
: -
a -
comparison -
with -
phenacetin D010615
. -

Six -
epidemiologic -
studies -
in -
the -
United -
States -
and -
Europe -
indicate -
that -
habitual -
use -
of -
phenacetin D010615
is -
associated -
with -
the -
development -
of -
chronic -
renal -
failure -
and -
end -
- -
stage -
renal -
disease -
( -
ESRD -
) -
, -
with -
a -
relative -
risk -
in -
the -
range -
of -
4 -
to -
19 -
. -

As -
a -
result -
of -
these -
and -
other -
studies -
, -
phenacetin D010615
has -
now -
been -
withdrawn -
from -
the -
market -
in -
most -
countries -
. -

However -
, -
three -
case -
control -
studies -
, -
one -
each -
in -
North -
Carolina -
, -
northern -
Maryland -
, -
and -
West -
Berlin -
, -
Germany -
, -
showed -
that -
habitual -
use -
of -
acetaminophen D000082
is -
also -
associated -
with -
chronic -
renal -
failure -
and -
ESRD -
, -
with -
a -
relative -
risk -
in -
the -
range -
of -
2 -
to -
4 -
. -

These -
studies -
suggest -
that -
both -
phenacetin D010615
and -
acetaminophen D000082
may -
contribute -
to -
the -
burden -
of -
ESRD -
, -
with -
the -
risk -
of -
the -
latter -
being -
somewhat -
less -
than -
that -
of -
the -
former -
. -

This -
apparent -
difference -
in -
risk -
may -
not -
be -
due -
to -
differences -
in -
nephrotoxic -
potential -
of -
the -
drugs -
themselves -
. -

A -
lower -
relative -
risk -
would -
be -
expected -
for -
acetaminophen D000082
if -
the -
risk -
of -
both -
drugs -
in -
combination -
with -
other -
analgesics -
was -
higher -
than -
the -
risk -
of -
either -
agent -
alone -
. -

Thus -
, -
acetaminophen D000082
has -
been -
used -
both -
as -
a -
single -
agent -
and -
in -
combination -
with -
other -
analgesics -
, -
whereas -
phenacetin D010615
was -
available -
only -
in -
combinations -
. -

The -
possibility -
that -
habitual -
use -
of -
acetaminophen D000082
alone -
increases -
the -
risk -
of -
ESRD -
has -
not -
been -
clearly -
demonstrated -
, -
but -
cannot -
be -
dismissed -

This -

as -
a -

) -
associated -

, -
namely -

, -

. -

Data -
from -
a -
Transnational -
case -

study -
were -
used -
to -
assess -
the -
risk -
of -
VTE -
for -
the -
latter -
patterns -
of -
use -
, -
while -
accounting -
for -
duration -
of -
use -
. -

Over -
the -
period -
1993 -
- -
1996 -
, -
551 -
cases -
of -
VTE -
were -
identified -
in -
Germany -
and -
the -
UK -
along -
with -
2066 -
controls -
. -

Totals -
of -
128 -
cases -
and -
650 -

were -
analysed -
for -
repeat -
use -
and -
135 -
cases -
and -
622 -
controls -
for -
switching -

. -

The -
adjusted -
rate -
ratio -
of -
VTE -
for -
repeat -
users -
of -

was -

We -
conclude -
that -
second -
and -

agents -
are -
associated -
with -
equivalent -
risks -
of -
VTE -
when -
the -

are -

the -
two -

These -
analyses -
suggest -
that -
the -
higher -
risk -
observed -
for -
the -
newer -
OC D003276
in -
other -
studies -
may -
be -
the -
result -

Many -

introduced -
over -
the -

Although -
urinary -

is -
listed -
as -

side -

In -
the -

, -
both -
of -
which -
could -
have -

to -
the -

Animal -
studies -

that -

antidepressants -
could -
be -
mediated -
by -
the -

Further -

there -
is -
a -
strong -
association -

the -
significance -
of -
mild -
PTCR -
and -
its -

is -
unclear -

PTCR -
also -
occurs -

diseases -
, -
though -
the -
association -
is -
not -
as -
strong -
as -
that -
for -

. -

We -
suggest -
that -

BACKGROUND -
: -
The -
septo -
- -
hippocampal -
cholinergic -
pathway -
has -
been -
implicated -
in -
epileptogenesis -
, -
and -
genetic -
factors -
influence -
the -

, -
but -

are -

on -
cholinergic -

Thus -
, -
the -
relationship -

RESULTS -
: -
Sensitivity -
to -

endpoints -
induced -
by -
nicotine D009538
, -
carbachol D002217
, -
and -
neostigmine D009388
were -
significantly -
greater -
in -
WSR -
versus -
WSP -
mice -
. -

In -
microdialysis -
experiments -
, -
the -
lines -
did -
not -
differ -
in -
basal -
release -
of -
ACh D000109

and -
50 -
mM -
KCl C522374
increased -
ACh D000109

in -
both -
lines -
of -

However -
, -
the -
increase -
in -
release -
of -
ACh D000109
produced -
by -
the -
first -
application -
of -
KCl C522374
was -
2 -
- -
fold -

in -
WSP -
versus -
WSR -
mice -
. -

When -
hippocampal -
ACh D000109
was -
measured -
during -
testing -
for -
handling -
- -
induced -
convulsions -
, -
extracellular -
ACh D000109
was -
significantly -
elevated -
( -

in -
WSP -
mice -
, -
but -
was -
nonsignificantly -
elevated -
( -
59 -
% -
) -
in -
WSR -
mice -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
These -
results -
suggest -
that -
differences -
in -
cholinergic -
activity -
and -
postsynaptic -
sensitivity -
to -
cholinergic -
convulsants -
may -
be -
associated -
with -
ethanol D000431

severity -
and -
implicate -
cholinergic -
mechanisms -
in -
alcohol D000431

. -

Specifically -
, -
WSP -
mice -
may -
have -
lower -
sensitivity -
to -
cholinergic -
convulsants -
compared -
with -
WSR -
because -
of -
postsynaptic -
receptor -

Risks -

Although -
the -
United -
States -
Food -
and -
Drug -
Administration -
banned -
its -
use -
for -
nocturnal -

quinine D011803
is -
widely -
available -
in -
beverages -
including -
tonic -

Numerous -
anecdotal -

Spread -
of -
the -
contrast -
medium -

were -
injected -
. -

After -
the -
injection -
, -
there -
was -
a -
reduction -
in -

symptoms -
. -

Three -
hours -
later -
, -
she -
complained -
of -
perineal -
numbness -
and -
lower -

. -

The -
neurologic -
evaluation -
revealed -
loss -
of -

Sirolimus D020123
- -
associated -
proteinuria -
and -
renal -
dysfunction -
. -

Sirolimus D020123
is -
a -
novel -
immunosuppressant -
with -
potent -
antiproliferative -
actions -
through -
its -
ability -
to -
inhibit -
the -
raptor -
- -
containing -
mammalian -
target -
of -
rapamycin D020123
protein -
kinase -
. -

Sirolimus D020123
represents -
a -
major -
therapeutic -
advance -
in -
the -
prevention -
of -
acute -
renal -
allograft -
rejection -
and -
chronic -
allograft -
nephropathy -
. -

Its -
role -
in -
the -
therapy -
of -
glomerulonephritis -
, -
autoimmunity -
, -
cystic -
renal -
diseases -
and -
renal -
cancer -
is -
under -
investigation -
. -

Because -
sirolimus D020123
does -
not -
share -
the -
vasomotor -
renal -
adverse -
effects -
exhibited -
by -
calcineurin -
inhibitors -
, -
it -
has -
been -
designated -
a -
' -
non -
- -
nephrotoxic -
drug -
' -
. -

However -
, -
clinical -
reports -
suggest -
that -
, -
under -
some -
circumstances -
, -
sirolimus D020123
is -
associated -
with -
proteinuria -
and -
acute -
renal -
dysfunction -
. -

A -
common -
risk -
factor -
appears -
to -
be -
presence -
of -
pre -
- -
existing -
chronic -
renal -
damage -
. -

The -
mechanisms -
of -
sirolimus D020123
- -
associated -
proteinuria -
are -
multifactorial -
and -
may -
be -
due -
to -
an -
increase -
in -
glomerular -
capillary -
pressure -
following -
calcineurin -
inhibitor -
withdrawal -
. -

It -
has -
also -
been -
suggested -
that -
sirolimus D020123
directly -
causes -
increased -
glomerular -
permeability -
/ -
injury -
, -
but -
evidence -
for -
this -
mechanism -
is -
currently -
inconclusive -
. -

The -
acute -
renal -
dysfunction -
associated -
with -
sirolimus D020123
( -
such -
as -
in -
delayed -
graft -
function -
) -
may -
be -
due -
to -
suppression -
of -
compensatory -
renal -
cell -
proliferation -
and -
survival -
/ -
repair -
processes -
. -

Although -
these -
adverse -
effects -
occur -
in -
some -
patients -
, -
their -
occurrence -
could -
be -
minimised -
by -
knowledge -
of -
the -
molecular -
effects -
of -
sirolimus D020123
on -
the -
kidney -
, -
the -
use -
of -
sirolimus D020123
in -
appropriate -
patient -
populations -
, -
close -
monitoring -
of -
proteinuria -
and -
renal -
function -
, -
use -
of -
angiotensin D000809
- -
converting -
enzyme -
inhibitors -
or -
angiotensin D000804
II -
receptor -
blockers -
if -
proteinuria -
occurs -
and -
withdrawal -
if -
needed -
. -

Further -
long -
- -
term -
analysis -
of -
renal -
allograft -
studies -
using -
sirolimus D020123
as -
de -
novo -
immunosuppression -
along -
with -
clinical -
and -
laboratory -
studies -
will -
refine -
these -
issues -
in -
the -
future -

Progressive -
myopathy -
with -
up -
- -
regulation -
of -
MHC -
- -
I -
associated -
with -
statin D019821
therapy -
. -

Statins D019821
can -
cause -
a -
necrotizing -
myopathy -
and -
hyperCKaemia -
which -
is -
reversible -
on -
cessation -
of -
the -
drug -
. -

What -
is -
less -
well -
known -
is -
a -
phenomenon -
whereby -
statins D019821
may -
induce -
a -
myopathy -
, -
which -
persists -
or -
may -
progress -
after -
stopping -
the -
drug -
. -

We -
investigated -
the -
muscle -
pathology -
in -
8 -
such -
cases -
. -

All -
had -
myofibre -
necrosis -
but -
only -
3 -
had -
an -
inflammatory -
infiltrate -
. -

In -
all -
cases -
there -
was -
diffuse -
or -
multifocal -
up -
- -
regulation -
of -
MHC -
- -
I -
expression -
even -
in -
non -
- -
necrotic -
fibres -
. -

Progressive -
improvement -
occurred -
in -
7 -
cases -
after -
commencement -
of -
prednisolone D011239
and -
methotrexate D008727
, -
and -
in -
one -
case -
spontaneously -
. -

These -
observations -
suggest -
that -
statins D019821
may -
initiate -
an -
immune -
- -
mediated -
myopathy -
that -
persists -
after -
withdrawal -
of -
the -
drug -
and -
responds -
to -
immunosuppressive -
therapy -
. -

The -
mechanism -
of -
this -
myopathy -
is -
uncertain -
but -
may -
involve -
the -
induction -
by -
statins D019821
of -
an -
endoplasmic -
reticulum -
stress -
response -
with -
associated -
up -
- -
regulation -
of -

smoking D012906
has -
been -
positively -

The -
objective -
of -
this -

was -
to -
determine -
the -

However -
, -
by -
comparing -

we -
found -
statistically -
significant -

CONCLUSION -
: -
In -
utero -
, -
exposure -
to -
tobacco -
smoking D012906
seems -
to -
have -
a -
small -
impact -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Cocaine D003042
is -
a -
widely -
abused -
psychostimulant -
that -
has -
both -

RESULTS -
: -
We -

A -
case -
is -
reported -

in -
a -

She -
was -

and -
after -
more -

three -
months -
, -
her -

; -
and -
six -
months -
after -
the -
onset -

This -
case -
emphasizes -
the -
possibility -
that -

and -
that -

describes -
neuropsychiatric -

occurred -
after -
both -

In -
a -

it -
is -

that -
one -

study -
was -
to -
clarify -
the -
incidence -
and -
severity -
of -
adverse -
cardiac -
effects -
to -
this -

Before -
treatment -
all -
patients -
had -
a -
cardiac -
evaluation -
and -
during -
treatment -
serial -
ECG -

were -
performed -

In -
the -
pre -

evaluation -
, -
signs -

were -
found -
in -
33 -
patients -

The -
incidence -
of -

was -
not -
higher -

The -
most -

signs -
of -
cardiotoxicity -
were -
chest -

This -
was -
followed -
by -
ventricular -

It -
is -
concluded -
that -

In -

could -
be -
due -
to -

Our -
results -
suggest -
that -
the -

the -
cause -

METHODS -
: -
For -

and -
immunohistochemical -
stainings -
for -
the -
presence -
of -
trifluoroacetyl D014269

INTERPRETATION -
: -
Repeated -
exposure -
of -
human -
beings -
to -
HCFCs C067411|C072959
123 -
and -
124 -
can -
result -
in -
serious -
liver -
injury -

Although -
the -
exact -
mechanism -
of -
hepatotoxicity -
of -
these -
agents -
is -

, -
the -
results -
suggest -
that -
trifluoroacetyl D014269

, -
TAM D013629
does -
not -
shift -
the -
osmotic -
fragility -
curves -
of -
erythrocytes -
. -

The -
hemolytic -
effect -
of -
TAM D013629
is -
prevented -
by -
low -
concentrations -
of -
alpha D024502
- -
tocopherol -
( -
alpha D024502
- -

) -
and -

acetate -
( -

) -
( -
inactivated -

indicating -
that -
TAM D013629
- -
induced -
hemolysis -
is -
not -
related -
to -
oxidative -
membrane -
damage -
. -

This -
was -
further -
evidenced -
by -
absence -
of -
oxygen D010100
consumption -
and -
hemoglobin -
oxidation -
both -
determined -
in -
parallel -
with -
TAM D013629
- -
induced -
hemolysis -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
it -
was -
observed -
that -
TAM D013629
inhibits -
the -
peroxidation -
of -
human -
erythrocytes -
induced -
by -
AAPH C046728
, -
thus -
ruling -
out -
TAM D013629
- -
induced -
cell -
oxidative -
stress -
. -

Hemolysis -
caused -
by -
TAM D013629
was -
not -
preceded -
by -
the -
leakage -
of -
K D011188
( -

) -
from -
the -
cells -
, -
also -
excluding -
a -
colloid -
- -
osmotic -
type -
mechanism -
of -
hemolysis -
, -
according -
to -
the -
effects -
on -
osmotic -
fragility -
curves -
. -

However -
, -
TAM D013629
induces -
release -
of -
peripheral -
proteins -
of -
membrane -
- -
cytoskeleton -
and -
cytosol -
proteins -
essentially -
bound -
to -
band -

. -

Either -
alpha D024502
- -
T -
or -
alpha D024502
- -
TAc -
increases -
membrane -
packing -
and -
prevents -
TAM D013629
partition -
into -
model -
membranes -
. -

These -
effects -
suggest -
that -
the -
protection -
from -
hemolysis -
by -
tocopherols D024505
is -
related -
to -
a -
decreased -
TAM D013629
incorporation -
in -
condensed -
membranes -
and -
the -
structural -
damage -
of -
the -
erythrocyte -
membrane -
is -
consequently -
avoided -
. -

Therefore -
, -
TAM D013629
- -
induced -
hemolysis -
results -
from -
a -
structural -
perturbation -
of -
red -
cell -
membrane -
, -
leading -
to -
changes -
in -
the -
framework -
of -
the -
erythrocyte -
membrane -
and -
its -
cytoskeleton -
caused -
by -
its -
high -
partition -
in -
the -
membrane -
. -

These -
defects -
explain -
the -
abnormal -
erythrocyte -
shape -
and -
decreased -
mechanical -
stability -
promoted -
by -
TAM D013629
, -
resulting -
in -
hemolytic -
anemia -
. -

Additionally -
, -
since -
membrane -
leakage -
is -
a -
final -
stage -
of -
cytotoxicity -
, -
the -
disruption -
of -
the -
structural -
characteristics -
of -

by -
TAM D013629
may -
contribute -
to -
the -
multiple -

Previous -

Given -
that -
sympathetic -

exhibits -
a -

developmental -
pattern -
, -
and -
given -
that -
clonidine D003000

we -
hypothesized -
that -
clonidine D003000
' -
s -
developmental -
effects -
on -

would -
mirror -

hypertensive -
man -
with -

Due -
to -

losartan D019808
was -
prescribed -
. -

Surprisingly -
, -
the -
first -
dose -
of -
50 -
mg -

losartan D019808
resulted -
in -
a -

lasted -
eight -

was -
prescribed -
again -
and -
after -
the -
second -
dose -
of -
50 -
mg -
, -
the -
patient -
developed -
a -

During -
these -
two -

In -
this -
patient -
, -
renal -
artery -
stenosis -
combined -
with -

Methylphenidate D008774

Cerebral -

We -
consider -

as -
the -

we -
hypothesized -
that -
the -
CX3CR1 -
plays -
a -
role -
in -
METH D008694
- -
induced -
neurotoxicity -
and -
microglial -
activation -
. -

Mice -
in -
which -
the -
CX3CR1 -
gene -
has -
been -
deleted -
and -
replaced -
with -
a -
cDNA -
encoding -
enhanced -
green -
fluorescent -
protein -
( -
eGFP -
) -
were -
treated -
with -
METH D008694
and -
examined -
for -
striatal -
neurotoxicity -
. -

METH D008694
depleted -
DA D004298
, -
caused -
microglial -
activation -
, -
and -
increased -
body -
temperature -
in -
CX3CR1 -
knockout -
mice -
to -
the -
same -
extent -
and -
over -
the -
same -
time -
course -
seen -
in -
wild -
- -
type -
controls -
. -

The -
effects -
of -
METH D008694
in -
CX3CR1 -
knockout -
mice -
were -
not -
gender -
- -
dependent -
and -
did -
not -
extend -
beyond -
the -
striatum -

Striatal -
microglia -
expressing -
eGFP -
constitutively -
show -
morphological -
changes -
after -
METH D008694
that -
are -
characteristic -
of -
activation -
. -

This -
response -
was -
restricted -
to -
the -
striatum -
and -
contrasted -
sharply -
with -
unresponsive -
eGFP -
- -
microglia -
in -
surrounding -
brain -
areas -
that -
are -
not -
damaged -
by -
METH D008694

We -
conclude -
from -
these -
studies -
that -
CX3CR1 -
signaling -
does -
not -
modulate -
METH D008694
neurotoxicity -
or -
microglial -
activation -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
it -
appears -
that -
striatal -
- -
resident -
microglia -
respond -
to -
METH D008694
with -
an -
activation -
cascade -
and -
then -
return -
to -
a -
surveying -
state -
without -
undergoing -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Topical -
papaverine D010208

as -
the -

etiology -
of -
the -
proteinuria -
. -

METHODS -
: -
We -
analyzed -
the -
clinical -
and -
laboratory -
information -
available -
for -
all -
119 -
patients -
transplanted -
at -
the -
Washington -
Hospital -
Center -
between -
1999 -
- -
2003 -
for -
whom -
sirolimus D020123
was -
a -
component -
of -
their -
immunosuppressant -
regimen -
. -

In -
these -
patients -
, -
the -
magnitude -
of -
proteinuria -
was -
assessed -
on -
morning -
urine -
samples -
by -
turbidometric -
measurement -
or -

urine -
protein -
: -

ratios -
, -

Laboratory -
results -
were -
compared -
between -
prior -
, -
during -
and -
following -
sirolimus D020123
use -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Twenty -
- -
eight -
patients -
( -
24 -
% -
) -
developed -
increased -
proteinuria -
from -
baseline -
during -
their -
post -
- -
transplantation -
course -
. -

In -
21 -
patients -
an -
alternative -
cause -
of -
proteinuria -
was -
either -
obvious -
or -
insufficient -
data -
was -
available -
to -
be -
conclusive -
. -

In -
7 -
of -
the -
28 -
patients -
there -
was -
a -
striking -
temporal -
association -
between -
the -
initiation -
of -
sirolimus D020123
and -
the -
development -
of -
nephrotic -
- -
range -
proteinuria -
. -

Proteinuria -
correlated -
most -
strongly -
with -
sirolimus D020123
therapy -
when -
compared -
to -
other -
demographic -
and -
clinical -
variables -
. -

In -
most -
patients -
, -
discontinuation -
of -
sirolimus D020123
resulted -
in -
a -
decrease -
, -
but -
not -
resolution -
, -
of -
proteinuria -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
Sirolimus D020123
induces -
or -
aggravates -
pre -
- -
existing -
proteinuria -
in -
an -
unpredictable -
subset -
of -
renal -
allograft -
recipients -
. -

Proteinuria -
may -
improve -

but -
does -
not -
resolve -

Significant -

were -
observed -
at -
1 -

postdose -
compared -
to -
baseline -
for -
both -
age -
groups -
with -
a -
trend -
toward -
return -
to -
baseline -
by -
5 -
hours -
postdose -
. -

For -
almost -
all -
cognitive -
measures -
, -
there -
were -
no -
medication -
by -
age -
- -
interaction -
effects -
, -
which -
indicates -
that -
the -
2 -
age -
groups -
exhibited -
similar -
responses -
to -
the -
medication -
challenge -
. -

This -
study -
suggests -
that -
for -
healthy -
older -
adults -
who -
are -
not -
suffering -
from -
chronic -
pain -
, -
neurocognitive -
and -
pharmacodynamic -
changes -
in -
response -
to -
a -
10 -
- -
mg -
dose -
of -
immediate -
- -
release -
oxycodone D010098
are -
similar -
to -
those -
observed -
for -
middle -
- -
aged -
adults -
. -

PERSPECTIVE -
: -
Study -
findings -
indicate -
that -
the -
metabolism -
, -
neurocognitive -
effects -
, -
and -
physical -
side -
effects -
of -
oral -
oxycodone D010098
are -
similar -
for -
healthy -
middle -
- -
aged -
and -
older -
adults -
. -

Therefore -
, -
clinicians -
should -
not -
avoid -
prescribing -
oral -
opioids -
to -
older -
adults -
based -
on -
the -
belief -
that -
older -
adults -
are -
at -
higher -
risk -
for -
side -

than -
younger -

CLINICAL -
SIGNIFICANCE -
: -
This -
clinical -
case -
showing -

was -
presented -
to -
help -
dental -
practitioners -
recognize -
and -
manage -
patients -
who -
may -
be -
abusing -

Dental -
practitioners -
also -
may -
be -
skeptical -
about -
the -
reliability -
of -

by -
these -
patients -

as -
they -
frequently -
miss -
their -

. -

Eating -
disorders -
and -
the -
associated -
behavioural -
problems -
and -
drug -
abuse -
are -
uncommon -
in -
pregnancy -
. -

When -
they -
do -
occur -
they -
are -
often -
unrecognized -
because -
of -
denial -
but -
when -
significant -
may -
pose -
a -
risk -
to -
both -
the -
mother -
and -
her -
fetus -
. -

This -
case -
illustrates -
a -
number -
of -
problems -
that -
may -
be -
encountered -
in -
women -
with -
eating -
disorders -
in -
pregnancy -
, -
including -
prolonged -
and -
recurrent -
metabolic -
disturbances -
and -

it -
illustrates -
the -
derangements -
of -
thyroid -
function -
seen -
in -
pregnant -
women -
with -
eating -
disorders -
and -
reminds -
us -
that -
when -
a -
cause -
for -
thyrotoxicosis -
remains -
obscure -
, -
thyroxine D013974
abuse -
should -
be -
considered -
and -

may -
be -
prolonged -
in -
patients -
with -
genetic -
variants -
of -
the -
butyrylcholinesterase -
enzyme -
( -

The -
aims -
of -
this -
study -
were -
to -
confirm -
our -
previous -
findings -
in -
a -
separate -
cohort -
of -
patients -
and -
to -
determine -
the -
time -

of -
the -
cardiovascular -
consequences -
of -
stopping -
selegiline D012642
in -
the -
expectation -
that -
this -
might -
shed -
light -
on -
the -
mechanisms -
by -
which -
the -

. -

METHODS -
: -
The -
cardiovascular -
responses -
to -
standing -
and -
head -
- -
up -
tilt -
were -
studied -
repeatedly -
in -
PD -
patients -
receiving -
selegiline D012642
and -
as -
the -
drug -
was -
withdrawn -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Head -
- -
up -
tilt -
caused -
systolic -
orthostatic -
hypotension -
which -
was -
marked -
in -
six -
of -
20 -
PD -
patients -
on -
selegiline D012642
, -
one -
of -
whom -
lost -
consciousness -
with -
unrecordable -
blood -
pressures -
. -

A -
lesser -
degree -
of -
orthostatic -
hypotension -
occurred -
with -
standing -
. -

Orthostatic -
hypotension -
was -
ameliorated -
4 -
days -
after -
withdrawal -
of -
selegiline D012642
and -
totally -
abolished -
7 -
days -
after -
discontinuation -
of -
the -
drug -
. -

Stopping -
selegiline D012642
also -
significantly -
reduced -
the -
supine -
systolic -
and -
diastolic -
blood -
pressures -
consistent -
with -
a -
previously -
undescribed -
supine -
pressor -
action -
. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
This -
study -
confirms -
our -
previous -
finding -
that -
selegiline D012642
in -
combination -
with -
L D007980
- -
dopa -
is -
associated -
with -
selective -
orthostatic -
hypotension -

The -
possibilities -
that -
these -
cardiovascular -
findings -
might -
be -
the -
result -
of -

. -

The -
pathophysiology -
of -
painful -
temporomandibular -
disorders -
is -
not -
fully -
understood -
, -
but -
evidence -
suggests -
that -
muscle -
pain -
modulates -
motor -
function -
in -
characteristic -
ways -
. -

This -
study -
tested -
the -
hypothesis -
that -
activation -
of -
nociceptive -
muscle -
afferent -
fibers -
would -
be -
linked -
to -
an -
increased -
excitability -
of -
the -
human -
jaw -
- -
stretch -
reflex -
and -
whether -
this -
process -
would -
be -
sensitive -
to -
length -
and -
velocity -
of -
the -
stretch -
. -

Capsaicin D002211
( -

was -
injected -
into -

were -
evoked -
in -
the -

by -
a -
stretch -
device -
with -
different -
velocities -
and -
displacements -
before -
, -
during -
, -
and -
after -
the -

The -
normalized -
reflex -
amplitude -
increased -
with -
an -
increase -
in -

at -
a -

Increased -
sensitivity -
of -
the -

could -
be -
one -

The -
aim -
of -
the -

was -
to -
find -
out -
whether -

adaptive -
changes -
in -
the -

in -
mice -
, -
both -
these -
effects -
being -
mediated -
by -
an -
alpha1 -
- -
adrenergic -
receptor -
. -

It -
may -
be -
concluded -
that -
, -
like -
other -
tricyclic -
antidepressants D000928
studied -
previously -
, -
TRI D014299
given -
repeatedly -
increases -
the -
responsiveness -
of -

as -
well -
as -

A -
question -
arises -
whether -
the -
reuptake -

is -
of -
any -
importance -
to -
the -
adaptive -

Although -

are -
generally -
applied -
as -
treatments -
for -

, -
it -
has -
been -
proposed -
that -
a -

serve -
as -
a -

was -
studied -
in -

. -

METHODS -
: -
In -
this -
study -
, -
WR242511 C068820
was -
administered -
intravenously -
( -

RESULTS -
: -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
These -

It -
is -
concluded -
that -

should -
not -
be -
pursued -
as -
a -

Neuroplasticity -
of -
the -
adult -
primate -
auditory -
cortex -
following -
cochlear -
hearing -
loss -
. -

Tonotopic -
organization -
is -
an -
essential -
feature -
of -
the -
primary -
auditory -
area -
( -
A1 -
) -
of -
primate -
cortex -
. -

In -
A1 -
of -
macaque -
monkeys -
, -
low -
frequencies -
are -
represented -
rostrolaterally -
and -
high -
frequencies -
are -
represented -
caudomedially -
. -

The -
purpose -
of -
this -
study -
was -
to -
determine -
if -
changes -
occur -
in -
this -
tonotopic -
organization -
following -
cochlear -
hearing -
loss -
. -

Under -
anesthesia -
, -
the -
superior -
temporal -
gyrus -
of -
adult -
macaque -
monkeys -
was -
exposed -
, -
and -
the -
tonotopic -
organization -
of -
A1 -
was -
mapped -
using -
conventional -
microelectrode -
recording -
techniques -
. -

Following -
recovery -
, -
the -
monkeys -
were -
selectively -
deafened -
for -
high -
frequencies -
using -
kanamycin D007612
and -
furosemide D005665
. -

The -
actual -
frequencies -
deafened -
were -
determined -
by -
the -
loss -
of -
tone -
- -
burst -
elicited -
auditory -
brainstem -
responses -
. -

Three -
months -
after -
deafening -
, -
A1 -
was -
remapped -
. -

Postmortem -
cytoarchitectural -
features -
identifying -
A1 -
were -
correlated -
with -
the -
electrophysiologic -
data -
. -

The -
results -
indicate -
that -
the -
deprived -
area -
of -
A1 -
undergoes -
extensive -
reorganization -
and -
becomes -
responsive -
to -
intact -
cochlear -
frequencies -
. -

The -
region -
of -
cortex -
that -
represents -
the -
low -
frequencies -
was -
not -
obviously -
affected -
by -
the -
cochlear -
hearing -
loss -
. -

Atypical -

following -
the -
use -
of -
subcutaneous -
sumatriptan D018170
are -
common -
, -
but -
of -
uncertain -
origin -
. -

They -
are -
almost -
always -
benign -
, -

can -
be -
mistaken -
for -
a -
serious -
adverse -
event -

are -
presented -
with -

OBJECTIVE -
: -
The -

is -
reportedly -
poor -
. -

However -
, -
no -

has -
reported -
the -
use -
of -
a -

to -
analyze -
the -

METHODS -
: -
A -

RESULTS -
: -
The -

In -
patients -
in -
the -

, -
all -

were -
located -
in -

CONCLUSION -
: -
Cocaine D003042

The -
authors -
present -
three -

with -
de -
novo -
absence -
epilepsy -
after -
administration -
of -
carbamazepine D002220
and -
vigabatrin D020888
. -

Despite -
the -
underlying -
diseases -
, -
the -
prognosis -
for -
drug -
- -
induced -
de -
novo -
absence -
seizure -
is -
good -
because -
it -
subsides -
rapidly -
after -
discontinuing -
the -
use -
of -
the -
offending -
drugs -
. -

The -
gamma D005680
- -
aminobutyric -
acid -
- -
transmitted -
thalamocortical -
circuitry -
accounts -
for -
a -
major -
part -
of -
the -
underlying -
neurophysiology -
of -
the -
absence -
epilepsy -
. -

Because -
drug -
- -
induced -
de -
novo -
absence -
seizure -
is -
rare -
, -
pro -
- -
absence -
drugs -
can -
only -
be -
considered -
a -
promoting -
factor -
. -

The -
underlying -
epileptogenecity -
of -
the -
patients -
or -
the -
synergistic -
effects -
of -
the -
accompanying -
drugs -
is -
required -
to -
trigger -
the -
de -
novo -
absence -
seizure -
. -

The -
possibility -
of -
drug -
- -
induced -
aggravation -
should -
be -
considered -
whenever -
an -
unexpected -
increase -
in -
seizure -
frequency -
and -
/ -
or -
new -
seizure -
types -
appear -
following -
a -
change -
in -
drug -
treatment -
. -

By -
understanding -
the -
underlying -
mechanism -
of -
absence -
epilepsy -
, -
we -
can -
avoid -
the -
inappropriate -
use -
of -
anticonvulsants -
in -
children -
with -
epilepsy -
and -
prevent -
drug -

induced -

In -

appeared -
after -

In -
the -
remaining -
three -

procainamide D011342
was -
administered -
orally -
for -
treatment -

These -
patients -
had -
Q -

In -

was -
rapidly -
diagnosed -
and -

with -
disappearance -
of -

of -
the -

In -
two -
patients -
, -
the -
arrhythmia -
degenerated -

both -
patients -
died -

In -
the -

, -
polymorphous -

These -

that -

can -
produce -
an -

Cellular -
mechanisms -
which -
account -
for -
disruption -
the -
blood -
- -
brain -

during -

are -
not -

The -

was -
to -
determine -
the -

to -
activate -
B2 -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -

not -

variants -
of -
the -

In -
the -
two -

We -
also -
carried -
out -

We -

the -
hypothesis -
that -
the -

There -
was -
a -
significant -
reduction -
of -

in -

The -

revealed -
a -
correlation -
of -
these -
parameters -
. -

We -
conclude -
that -
phenytoin D010672
overdosage -
does -
not -
necessarily -
result -
in -
cerebellar -
atrophy -
and -
it -
is -
unlikely -
that -

was -
the -
only -
cause -
of -

a -
discrepancy -
between -
the -
amount -
of -

cell -
damage -
determined -
by -
the -

The -

are -
disadvantages -
in -

We -

The -
addition -
of -
ephedrine D004809
to -

appears -
to -
be -
an -
effective -
method -

Due -
to -
the -

was -
considered -

In -
six -
of -
the -
probable -
cases -
the -
neurological -
disturbance -
consisted -
of -
an -
acute -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Fibrin -
sealants -
( -
FS -
) -
derived -
from -
human -
plasma -
are -
frequently -
used -
in -
neurosurgery -
. -

In -
order -
to -
increase -
clot -
stability -
, -
FS -
typically -
contain -
aprotinin -
, -
a -
natural -
fibrinolysis -
inhibitor -
. -

Recently -
, -
synthetic -
fibrinolysis -
inhibitors -
such -
as -
tranexamic D014148
acid -
( -
tAMCA D014148
) -
have -
been -
considered -
as -
substitutes -
for -
aprotinin -
. -

However -
, -
tAMCA D014148
has -
been -
shown -
to -
cause -
epileptic -
seizures -
. -

We -
wanted -
to -
study -
whether -
tAMCA D014148
retains -
its -
convulsive -
action -
if -
incorporated -
into -
a -
FS -
. -

METHOD -
: -
FS -
containing -
aprotinin -
or -
different -
concentrations -
of -
tAMCA D014148
( -
0 -
. -
5 -
- -
47 -
. -
5 -
mg -

ml -
) -
were -
applied -
to -
the -
pial -
surface -
of -
the -
cortex -
of -
anaesthetized -
rats -
. -

The -
response -
of -
the -
animals -
was -
evaluated -
using -
electroencephalography -
and -
by -
monitoring -
the -
clinical -
behaviour -
during -
and -
after -
recovery -
from -
anaesthesia -
. -

FINDINGS -
: -
FS -
containing -
tAMCA D014148
caused -
paroxysmal -
brain -
activity -
which -
was -
associated -
with -
distinct -
convulsive -
behaviours -
. -

The -
degree -
of -
these -
seizures -
increased -
with -
increasing -
concentration -
of -
tAMCA D014148
. -

Thus -
, -
FS -
containing -
47 -
. -
5 -
mg -
/ -
ml -
tAMCA D014148
evoked -
generalized -
seizures -
in -
all -
tested -
rats -
( -
n -

while -
the -
lowest -
concentration -
of -
tAMCA D014148
( -
0 -
. -
5 -
mg -
/ -
ml -
) -
only -
evoked -
brief -
episodes -
of -
jerk -
- -
correlated -
convulsive -
potentials -
in -
1 -
of -
6 -
rats -
. -

In -
contrast -
, -
FS -
containing -
aprotinin -
did -
not -
evoke -
any -
paroxysmal -
activity -
. -

INTERPRETATION -
: -
Tranexamic D014148
acid -
retains -
its -
convulsive -
action -
within -
FS -
. -

Thus -
, -
use -
of -
FS -
containing -
tAMCA D014148
for -
surgery -
within -
or -
close -
to -
the -
CNS -
may -
pose -
a -
substantial -
risk -

Previous -
research -
in -
this -
laboratory -
has -
shown -
that -
a -
diet -
of -
intermittent -
excessive -
sugar -
consumption -
produces -
a -
state -
with -
neurochemical -
and -
behavioral -
similarities -
to -
drug -
dependency -
. -

The -
present -
study -
examined -
whether -
female -
rats -
on -
various -
regimens -
of -
sugar -
access -
would -
show -
behavioral -
cross -
- -
sensitization -
to -
a -
low -
dose -
of -
amphetamine D000661

. -

The -
animals -
that -
had -
experienced -

were -
hyperactive -
in -

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
a -
diet -
comprised -
of -
alternating -
deprivation -
and -
access -
to -
a -
sugar -
solution -
and -
chow -
produces -
bingeing -

that -
leads -
to -
a -
long -
lasting -
state -
of -
increased -
sensitivity -
to -
amphetamine D000661

possibly -
due -
to -
a -

Immunosuppressive -
drugs -
have -
been -
used -
during -
the -
last -
30 -
years -
in -
treatment -
of -
patients -
with -
severe -
rheumatoid -
arthritis -
. -

The -
drugs -
commonly -
used -
are -
cyclophosphamide D003520
and -
chlorambucil D002699
( -
alkylating D000477
agents -
) -
, -
azathioprine D001379

, -
and -
methotrexate D008727
( -
folic D005492

There -
is -
evidence -
that -
all -
four -
immunosuppressive -
drugs -
can -
reduce -
synovitis -
, -
but -
disease -
activity -
almost -
always -
recurs -
after -
therapy -
is -
stopped -

Since -
adverse -
reactions -
are -
frequent -
, -
less -
than -
50 -
percent -
of -
patients -
are -
able -
to -
continue -
a -
particular -
drug -
for -
more -
than -
one -
year -

Since -
it -
takes -
three -

12 -
months -
to -
achieve -
maximal -
effects -
, -
those -
patients -
who -
are -
unable -
to -
continue -
the -
drug -
receive -
little -
benefit -
from -
it -

Patients -
treated -
with -
alkylating D000477
agents -
have -
an -
increased -
risk -
of -
development -
of -
acute -
nonlymphocytic -
leukemia -
, -
and -
both -
alkylating D000477

Therefore -
, -
patients -
with -
glioblastoma -
sometimes -
have -
intracarotid -
injection -
of -
carcinostatics -
added -
to -
the -
treatment -
regimen -
. -

Generally -
, -
carboplatin D016190
is -
said -
to -
have -
milder -
side -
effects -
than -
cisplatin D002945
, -
whose -
ocular -
and -
orbital -
toxicity -
are -
well -
known -
. -

However -
, -
we -
experienced -
a -
case -
of -
severe -
ocular -
and -
orbital -
toxicity -
after -
intracarotid -
injection -
of -
carboplatin D016190

CASE -
: -
A -
58 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
man -
received -
an -
intracarotid -
injection -
of -
carboplatin D016190
for -
recurrent -
glioblastomas -
in -
his -
left -
temporal -
lobe -
. -

He -
complained -
of -
pain -
and -
visual -
disturbance -
in -
the -
ipsilateral -
eye -
30 -
h -
after -
the -
injection -
. -

Various -
ocular -
symptoms -
and -
findings -
caused -
by -
carboplatin D016190
toxicity -
were -
seen -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
He -
was -
treated -
with -
intravenous -
administration -
of -
corticosteroids -
and -
glycerin D005990
for -
6 -
days -
after -
the -
injection -
. -

Although -
the -
intraocular -
pressure -

caused -
by -
secondary -
acute -
angle -
- -

glaucoma -
decreased -
and -
ocular -
pain -
diminished -
, -
inexorable -
papilledema -
and -
exudative -

weeks -
. -

Finally -
, -
6 -
weeks -
later -
, -
diffuse -

atrophy -
with -
optic -

occurred -
and -
the -
vision -

CONCLUSION -
: -
When -
performing -
intracarotid -
injection -
of -
carboplatin D016190
, -
we -
must -
be -
aware -
of -
its -
potentially -

It -
is -
recommended -
that -
further -

, -
two -
widely -
used -
and -
highly -

chemotherapeutic -
drugs -
. -

This -
approach -
allowed -
investigating -
the -
efficacy -
of -

In -
conclusion -
mitochondrial -

These -
findings -
suggest -
that -

might -
reduce -
the -
risk -

a -

is -
a -

for -
a -
well -
- -

model -
in -
which -
these -

can -
be -
studied -
. -

In -
four -
subacute -
toxicity -
studies -
, -
the -
intravenous -
administration -
of -
cefonicid D015790
or -
cefazedone C021341
to -
beagle -
dogs -
caused -
a -
dose -

incidence -
of -
anemia -
, -
neutropenia -
, -
and -
thrombocytopenia -
after -
1 -
- -
3 -
months -
of -
treatment -

A -
nonregenerative -
anemia -
was -
the -
most -
compromising -
of -
the -
cytopenias -
and -
occurred -
in -
approximately -
50 -

. -

All -
three -
cytopenias -
were -
completely -
reversible -
following -
cessation -
of -
treatment -
; -
the -
time -
required -
for -
recovery -
of -
the -

approximately -
1 -

considerably -
longer -
than -
that -

Upon -
rechallenge -
with -
either -
cephalosporin D002511
, -
the -
hematologic -

was -
reproduced -
in -

; -
cefonicid D015790
( -

This -
observation -

along -
with -
the -
rapid -
rate -
of -
decline -
in -
red -
cell -
mass -
parameters -
of -

, -
suggests -
that -
a -
hemolytic -
component -
complicated -
the -
red -
cell -
production -
problem -
and -
that -
multiple -
toxicologic -
mechanisms -
contributed -
to -
the -

. -

We -
conclude -
that -
the -
administration -
of -
high -
doses -
of -
cefonicid D015790
or -
cefazedone C021341
to -
dogs -
can -
induce -
hematotoxicity -
similar -
to -
the -
cephalosporin D002511
- -

described -
in -

provides -

OBJECTIVE -
: -
Despite -

METHODS -
: -
This -
double -

RESULTS -
: -
Omission -

not -
reduce -
the -

and -
analgesic -
requirements -
were -
unaffected -
by -
the -
omission -
of -
fentanyl D005283

CONCLUSION -
: -
As -
fentanyl D005283

without -
an -
improvement -
in -
postoperative -
pain -

Pretreatment -

could -
protect -
the -

it -
is -
suggested -
that -
the -

Therefore -
, -
like -

, -
the -
finding -
that -

could -
drastically -
reduce -
pilocarpine D010862
- -
induced -
increases -
in -
glutamate D018698

The -
role -
of -
nicotine D009538
in -
smoking -
- -
related -
cardiovascular -
disease -
. -

Nicotine D009538
activates -
the -
sympathetic -
nervous -
system -
and -
in -
this -
way -
could -
contribute -
to -
cardiovascular -
disease -
. -

Animal -
studies -
and -
mechanistic -
studies -
indicate -
that -
nicotine D009538
could -
play -
a -
role -
in -
accelerating -
atherosclerosis -
, -
but -
evidence -
among -
humans -
is -
too -
inadequate -
to -
be -
definitive -
about -
such -
an -
effect -
. -

Almost -
certainly -
, -
nicotine D009538
via -
its -
hemodynamic -
effects -
contributes -
to -
acute -
cardiovascular -
events -
, -
although -
current -
evidence -
suggests -
that -
the -
effects -
of -
nicotine D009538
are -
much -
less -
important -
than -
are -
the -
prothrombotic -
effects -
of -
cigarette -
smoking -
or -
the -
effects -
of -
carbon D002248
monoxide -
. -

Nicotine D009538
does -
not -
appear -
to -
enhance -
thrombosis -
among -
humans -
. -

Clinical -
studies -
of -
pipe -
smokers -
and -
people -
using -
transdermal -
nicotine D009538
support -
the -
idea -
that -
toxins -
other -
than -
nicotine D009538
are -
the -
most -
important -
causes -
of -
acute -
cardiovascular -
events -
. -

Finally -
, -
the -
dose -
response -
for -
cardiovascular -
events -
of -
nicotine D009538
appears -
to -
be -
flat -
, -
suggesting -
that -
if -
nicotine D009538
is -
involved -
, -
adverse -
effects -
might -
be -
seen -
with -
relatively -
low -

Hyperkalemia -

Hyperkalemia -
has -

a -
complication -
of -
nonsteroidal -
antiinflammatory -
agents -
( -
NSAID -

such -
as -
indomethacin D007213
. -

Several -
recent -
studies -
have -
stressed -
the -
renal -
sparing -
features -
of -
sulindac D013467
, -
owing -
to -
its -
lack -
of -
interference -
with -
renal -
prostacyclin D011464

We -
describe -

As -
no -

serum -
potassium D011188

this -

of -
a -
cause -
- -
and -
- -
effect -
relationship -
between -
sulindac D013467
and -

These -
observations -
indicate -
that -
initial -
hopes -
that -
sulindac D013467
may -
not -
be -
associated -
with -
the -
adverse -
renal -
effects -
of -

This -
case -
illustrates -
that -
patients -

may -
risk -
interactions -
between -
the -

of -
ritodrine D012312
and -
the -
effects -
of -

Such -
interactions -
may -
result -
in -
serious -
cardiovascular -
complications -
even -
after -
cessation -
of -
an -

Preoperative -
assessment -
should -
focus -

increased -
, -
while -
the -
volume -

These -

suggest -
that -
lowered -
serum -
prolactin -
levels -
in -
the -
early -
phase -
of -
bromocriptine D001971
treatment -
may -
result -
from -
an -
impaired -
secretion -
of -

due -
to -
decreasing -
numbers -
of -
cytoplasmic -

. -

At -
6 -

serum -
prolactin -

The -

and -
a -

in -
the -
volume -

of -

was -
determined -
by -
morphometric -
analysis -
, -
suggesting -
that -
bromocriptine D001971
inhibits -

In -
the -

both -
the -

both -
the -
RNA -
content -
and -
ribosomal -

were -
reduced -
in -
the -
gastrocnemius -

It -
is -
suggested -
that -
the -
drug -
acted -
in -
a -
selective -

tissue -
- -
specific -
manner -
to -
enhance -
ribosomal -

This -

The -
half -
- -
life -
( -

of -
cocaine D003042
is -
relatively -
short -
, -
but -
some -
of -
the -
consequences -
of -
its -
use -
, -
such -
as -
seizures -
and -
strokes -
, -
can -
occur -
hours -
after -
exposure -
. -

This -
led -
us -
to -
hypothesize -
that -
a -
metabolite -
of -
cocaine D003042
may -
be -
responsible -
for -
some -
of -
those -
delayed -
sequelae -

BE C005618
- -
Induced -
seizures -
occurred -
more -
frequently -
and -
had -
significantly -
longer -
latencies -
than -
those -
induced -
by -
equimolar -
amounts -
of -

Whereas -
cocaine D003042
- -

seizures -
were -
best -
characterized -

, -

were -
prolonged -

mixed -
in -
type -
, -
and -
rarely -
resulted -
in -

BE C005618
- -
Injected -
rats -
that -

had -
significantly -

The -
finding -
that -

- -
and -
BE C005618
- -
induced -
seizures -
differ -
in -
several -
respects -
suggests -
more -
than -
one -
mechanism -
for -

, -
so -
that -
this -
rat -
strain -
was -
very -
helpful -
in -
defining -
substrates -
of -
MRP2 -
by -
comparing -
tissue -
concentrations -

of -

in -

with -
those -

By -
using -
this -
strategy -
to -
study -
the -
involvement -
of -
MRP2 -
in -
brain -
access -
of -
antiepileptic -
drugs -
( -
AEDs -
) -
, -
we -
recently -
reported -
that -
phenytoin D010672
is -
a -
substrate -
for -
MRP2 -
in -
the -
BBB -
. -

However -
, -
one -
drawback -
of -
such -
studies -
in -
genetically -
deficient -
rats -
is -
the -
fact -
that -
compensatory -
changes -
with -
upregulation -
of -
other -
transporters -
can -
occur -
. -

This -
prompted -
us -
to -
study -
the -
brain -
expression -
of -
P -
- -
glycoprotein -
( -
Pgp -
) -
, -
a -
major -
drug -

) -
rats -
compared -
with -

) -
Wistar -

. -

METHODS -
: -
The -
expression -
of -
MRP2 -
and -
Pgp -
in -
brain -
and -
liver -
sections -
of -
TR -
( -
- -
) -
rats -
and -
normal -
Wistar -
rats -
was -
determined -
with -
immunohistochemistry -
, -
by -
using -
a -
novel -
, -
highly -
selective -
monoclonal -
MRP2 -
antibody -
and -
the -
monoclonal -
Pgp -
antibody -
C219 -
, -
respectively -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
Immunofluorescence -
staining -
with -
the -
MRP2 -
antibody -
was -
found -
to -
label -
a -
high -
number -
of -
microvessels -
throughout -
the -
brain -
in -
normal -
Wistar -
rats -
, -
whereas -
such -
labeling -
was -
absent -
in -
TR -
( -
- -
) -
rats -
. -

TR -
( -
- -
) -
rats -
exhibited -
a -
significant -
up -
- -
regulation -
of -
Pgp -
in -
brain -
capillary -
endothelial -
cells -
compared -
with -
wild -
- -
type -
controls -
. -

No -
such -
obvious -
upregulation -
of -
Pgp -
was -
observed -
in -
liver -
sections -
. -

A -
comparable -
overexpression -
of -
Pgp -
in -
the -
BBB -
was -
obtained -
after -
pilocarpine D010862
- -
induced -
seizures -
in -
wild -

type -
Wistar -
rats -
. -

Experiments -
with -
systemic -
administration -
of -
the -
Pgp -
substrate -
phenobarbital D010634
and -
the -
selective -
Pgp -
inhibitor -
tariquidar C402343
in -
TR -
( -
- -
) -
rats -
substantiated -
that -
Pgp -
is -
functional -
and -
compensates -
for -
the -
lack -
of -
MRP2 -
in -
the -
BBB -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
The -
data -
on -
TR -
( -
- -
) -
rats -
indicate -
that -
Pgp -
plays -
an -
important -
role -
in -
the -
compensation -
of -
MRP2 -
deficiency -
in -
the -
BBB -
. -

Because -
such -
a -
compensatory -
mechanism -
most -
likely -
occurs -
to -
reduce -
injury -
to -
the -
brain -
from -
cytotoxic -
compounds -
, -
the -
present -
data -
substantiate -
the -
concept -
that -
MRP2 -
performs -
a -
protective -
role -
in -
the -
BBB -
. -

Furthermore -
, -
our -
data -
suggest -
that -
TR -
( -
- -
) -
rats -
are -
an -
interesting -
tool -
to -
study -
consequences -
of -
overexpression -
of -
Pgp -
in -
the -
BBB -
on -

In -

RESULTS -
: -
Five -

ABSTRACT -

Effects -
of -
aminophylline D000628
on -
the -
threshold -
for -
initiating -
ventricular -
fibrillation -
during -
respiratory -
failure -
. -

Cardiac -
arrhythmias -
have -
frequently -
been -
reported -
in -
association -
with -
respiratory -
failure -
. -

The -
possible -
additive -
role -
of -
pharmacologic -
agents -
in -
precipitating -
cardiac -
disturbances -
in -
patients -
with -
respiratory -
failure -
has -
only -
recently -
been -
emphasized -
. -

The -
effects -
of -
aminophylline D000628
on -
the -
ventricular -
fibrillation -
threshold -
during -
normal -
acid -
- -
base -
conditions -
and -
during -
respiratory -
failure -
were -
studied -
in -
anesthetized -
open -
chest -
dogs -
. -

The -
ventricular -
fibrillation -
threshold -
was -
measured -
by -
passing -
a -
gated -
train -
of -
12 -
constant -
current -
pulses -
through -
the -
ventricular -
myocardium -
during -
the -
vulnerable -
period -
of -
the -
cardiac -
cycle -
. -

During -
the -
infusion -
of -
aminophylline D000628
, -
the -
ventricular -
fibrillation -
threshold -
was -
reduced -
by -
30 -
to -
40 -
percent -
of -
the -
control -
when -
pH -
and -
partial -
pressures -
of -
oxygen D010100
( -
PO2 C093415
) -
and -
carbon D002245
dioxide -
( -
CO2 D002245
) -
were -
kept -
within -
normal -
limits -
. -

When -
respiratory -
failure -
was -
produced -
by -
hypoventilation -
( -
pH -

) -
, -
infusion -
of -
aminophylline D000628
resulted -
in -
an -
even -
greater -
decrease -
in -
ventricular -
fibrillation -
threshold -
to -
60 -
percent -
of -
the -
control -
level -
. -

These -
experiments -
suggest -
that -
although -
many -
factors -
may -
contribute -
to -
the -
increased -
incidence -
of -
ventricular -
arrhythmias -
in -
respiratory -
failure -
, -
pharmacologic -
agents -
, -
particularly -
aminophylline D000628
, -
may -
play -
a -

INTRODUCTION -
: -
Intoxications -

. -

METHODS -
: -
The -
son -
of -
an -
84 -
- -
year -
- -
old -
male -
discovered -
a -
newspaper -
report -
stating -
clinical -
success -
with -
plant -
extracts -
in -
Alzheimer -
' -
s -
disease -
. -

The -
mode -
of -
action -
was -
said -
to -
be -
comparable -
to -
that -
of -
the -
synthetic -
compound -
' -
carbamylcholin D002217
' -
; -
that -
is -
, -
carbachol D002217
. -

He -
bought -
25 -
g -
of -
carbachol D002217
as -
pure -
substance -
in -
a -
pharmacy -
, -
and -
the -
father -
was -
administered -
400 -
to -
500 -
mg -
. -

Carbachol D002217
concentrations -
in -
serum -
and -
urine -
on -
day -
1 -
and -
2 -
of -
hospital -
admission -
were -
analysed -
by -
HPLC -
- -
mass -

. -

RESULTS -
: -
Minutes -
after -
oral -
administration -
, -
the -
patient -
developed -
nausea -
, -
sweating -
and -
hypotension -
, -
and -
finally -
collapsed -
. -

Bradycardia -
, -
cholinergic -
symptoms -
and -
asystole -
occurred -
. -

Initial -
cardiopulmonary -
resuscitation -
and -
immediate -
treatment -
with -
adrenaline D004837
( -
epinephrine D004837
) -
, -
atropine D001285
and -
furosemide D005665
was -
successful -
. -

On -
hospital -
admission -
, -
blood -
pressure -
of -
the -
intubated -
, -
bradyarrhythmic -
patient -
was -
100 -
/ -
65 -
mmHg -
. -

Further -
signs -
were -
hyperhidrosis -
, -
hypersalivation -
, -
bronchorrhoea -
, -
and -
severe -
miosis -
; -
the -
electrocardiographic -
finding -
was -
atrio -
- -
ventricular -
dissociation -
. -

High -
doses -
of -
atropine D001285
( -
up -
to -
50 -
mg -
per -
24 -
hours -
) -
, -
adrenaline D004837
and -
dopamine D004298
were -
necessary -
. -

The -
patient -
was -
extubated -
1 -
week -
later -
. -

However -
, -
increased -
dyspnoea -
and -
bronchospasm -
necessitated -
reintubation -
. -

Respiratory -
insufficiency -
was -
further -
worsened -
by -
Proteus -
mirabilis -
infection -
and -
severe -
bronchoconstriction -
. -

One -
week -
later -
, -
the -
patient -
was -
again -
extubated -
and -
3 -
days -
later -
was -
transferred -
to -
a -
peripheral -
ward -
. -

On -
the -
next -
day -
he -
died -
, -
probably -
as -
a -
result -
of -
heart -
failure -
. -

Serum -
samples -
from -
the -
first -
and -

? -

BACKGROUND -
/ -
AIMS -
: -
Recently -
ribavirin D012254
has -
been -
found -
to -
inhibit -
angiogenesis -
and -
a -
number -
of -
angiogenesis -
inhibitors -
such -
as -
sunitinib C473478
and -
sorafenib C471405
have -
been -
found -
to -
cause -
acute -
hemolysis -
. -

We -
aimed -
to -
investigate -
whether -
there -
is -
a -
relation -
between -
hemoglobin -
, -
haptoglobin -
and -
angiogenesis -
soluble -
markers -
which -
are -
modifiable -
and -
can -
help -
in -
developing -
strategies -
against -
anemia -
. -

METHODS -
: -
Fourteen -
patients -
chronically -
infected -
with -
hepatitis -
C -
virus -
were -
treated -
by -
pegylated C100416
interferon -
alpha -
2a -
and -
ribavirin D012254
. -

Serum -
hemoglobin -
, -
haptoglobin -
and -
angiogenesis -
markers -
of -
vascular -
endothelial -
growth -
factor -
and -
angiopoetin -
- -
2 -
were -
investigated -
before -
and -
after -
therapy -
. -

RESULTS -
: -
We -
observed -
a -
significant -
decrease -
in -
haptoglobin -
levels -
at -
the -
end -
of -
the -
treatment -
period -
. -

Hemoglobin -
levels -
also -
decreased -
but -
insignificantly -
by -
treatment -
. -

In -
contrast -
with -
the -
literature -
, -
serum -
levels -
of -
angiogenesis -
factors -
did -
not -
change -
significantly -
by -
pegylated C417083
interferon -
and -
ribavirin D012254
therapy -
. -

We -
found -
no -
correlation -
of -
angiogenesis -
soluble -
markers -
with -
either -
hemoglobin -
or -
haptoglobin -
. -

CONCLUSION -
: -
This -
is -
the -
first -
study -
in -
the -
literature -
investigating -
a -
link -
between -
angiogenesis -
soluble -
markers -
and -
ribavirin D012254
induced -
anemia -
in -
patients -
with -
hepatitis -
C -
and -
we -
could -
not -
find -
any -
relation -
. -

Future -
research -
with -
larger -
number -
of -
patients -
is -
needed -
to -
find -
out -
modifiable -
factors -
that -
will -
improve -
the -
safety -
of -

Different -
mechanisms -
have -
been -
suggested -
for -
cocaine D003042
toxicity -
including -
an -

the -
association -
between -

status -
in -

and -
cocaine D003042
induced -

behaviour -
is -
poorly -

Nuclear -

( -

is -
a -
sensor -

peroxidase -
activity -
in -
the -
hippocampus -
, -
whereas -
nNOS -
activity -
in -
the -
hippocampus -
was -
increased -
. -

Memory -
retrieval -
of -
experiences -
acquired -
prior -
to -
cocaine D003042
administration -
was -
impaired -
and -
negatively -
correlated -
with -
NFkappaB -
activity -
in -
the -
frontal -
cortex -
. -

In -
contrast -
, -
learning -
of -
new -
tasks -
was -
enhanced -
and -
correlated -
with -
the -
increase -
of -
nNOS -
activity -
and -
the -
decrease -
of -

These -
results -
provide -
evidence -
for -
a -
possible -
mechanistic -
role -

, -
phenobarbitone D010634
and -
carbamazepine D002220
are -
well -
known -
to -
cause -

The -
increase -
in -

has -
been -
implicated -
as -
one -
of -
the -
important -
mechanisms -
of -
cognitive -

Curcumin D003474
has -
shown -
antioxidant -
, -
anti -

inflammatory -
and -
neuro -
- -
protective -
properties -
. -

Therefore -
, -
the -
present -
study -
was -
carried -
out -
to -
investigate -
the -
effect -
of -
chronic -
curcumin D003474

on -
phenobarbitone D010634
- -
and -
carbamazepine D002220
- -

. -

Pharmacokinetic -
interactions -
of -
curcumin D003474
with -
phenobarbitone D010634
and -
carbamazepine D002220
were -
also -
studied -
. -

Vehicle -

21days -
to -
male -

estimated -
. -

The -
administration -
of -
phenobarbitone D010634
and -
carbamazepine D002220
for -
21days -
caused -
a -
significant -
impairment -
of -
learning -
and -
memory -
as -
well -
as -
an -
increased -
oxidative -

. -

Concomitant -
curcumin D003474
administration -
prevented -
the -
cognitive -
impairment -
and -
decreased -
the -
increased -
oxidative -
stress -
induced -
by -
these -
antiepileptic -
drugs -
. -

Curcumin D003474
co -
- -
administration -
did -
not -
cause -
any -
significant -
alteration -
in -
the -
serum -
concentrations -
of -
both -
phenobarbitone D010634
as -
well -
as -
carbamazepine D002220
. -

These -
results -
show -
that -
curcumin D003474
has -
beneficial -
effect -
in -
mitigating -
the -
deterioration -
of -
cognitive -
functions -
and -
oxidative -
damage -
in -
rats -
treated -
with -
phenobarbitone D010634
and -
carbamazepine D002220
without -
significantly -
altering -
their -

. -

The -
findings -
suggest -
that -
curcumin D003474
can -
be -
considered -
as -
a -
potential -
safe -
and -
effective -
adjuvant -
to -
phenobarbitone D010634

Idiopathic -

tinnitus -
( -

is -
one -
of -
the -
most -
obscure -
otological -
pathologies -

This -
paper -
presents -
the -
results -
of -
treating -
IST -
by -
intratympanic -
instillation -
of -
lignocaine D008012
( -
lidocaine D008012
) -
2 -
per -
cent -
through -
a -
grommet -
, -
for -
five -
weekly -
courses -
. -

Fifty -
- -
two -
patients -
suffering -
from -
intractable -
tinnitus -
entered -
this -
therapeutic -
trial -
, -
but -
only -
nine -
finished -
all -
five -
courses -
. -

In -
one -
patient -
, -
the -
tinnitus -
was -
almost -
completely -
abolished -
, -
but -
in -
all -
the -
nine -
patients -
the -
decompensated -
tinnitus -
changed -
to -
a -
compensated -
one -
. -

We -
suggest -
this -
mode -
of -
treatment -
for -
patients -
that -
were -
previously -
treated -
by -
drugs -
, -
acupuncture -
and -
biofeedback -
, -
with -
disappointing -
results -
. -

Patients -
should -
be -
warned -
about -
the -
side -
effects -
of -
vertigo -
and -
vomiting -
, -
which -
subsides -
gradually -
with -
every -
new -
instillation -
, -
and -
that -
the -
tinnitus -
may -
not -
disappear -
but -
will -
be -
alleviated -
, -
enabling -
them -
to -
cope -
more -
easily -
with -
the -
disease -
and -
lead -
a -
more -
normal -
life -

Peripheral -
neuropathy -
has -
been -
noted -
as -
a -
complication -
of -
therapy -
with -
perhexiline C023470
maleate -
, -
a -
drug -
widely -
used -
in -
France -
( -
and -
in -
clinical -
trials -
in -
the -
United -
States -
) -
for -
the -
prophylactic -
treatment -
of -
angina -
pectoris -
. -

In -
24 -
patients -
with -
this -
complication -
, -
the -
marked -
slowing -
of -
motor -
nerve -
conduction -
velocity -
and -
the -
electromyographic -
changes -
imply -
mainly -
a -
demyelinating -
disorder -
. -

Improvement -
was -
noted -
with -
cessation -
of -
therapy -
. -

In -
a -
few -
cases -
the -
presence -
of -
active -
denervation -
signified -
a -
poor -
prognosis -
, -
with -
only -
slight -
improvement -
. -

The -
underlying -
mechanism -
causing -
the -
neuropathy -
is -
not -
yet -
fully -
known -
, -
although -
some -
evidence -
indicates -
that -
it -
may -
be -
a -
lipid -

The -

The -
subcutaneous -
administration -
of -
10 -
mg -
/ -
kg -
of -
morphine D009020
- -
HC1 -
produced -
a -
marked -
increase -
in -
locomotor -
activity -
in -
mice -
. -

The -
morphine D009020
- -
induced -
hyperactivity -
was -
potentiated -
by -
scopolamine D012601
and -
attenuated -
by -
physostigmine D010830
. -

In -
contrast -
, -
both -
methscopolamine D019832
and -
neostigmine D009388
, -
which -
do -
not -
penetrate -
the -
blood -
- -
brain -
barrier -
, -
had -
no -
effect -
on -
the -
hyperactivity -
produced -
by -
morphine D009020
. -

Pretreatment -

, -
an -
inhibitor -

hydroxylase -
, -
significantly -
decreased -
the -

) -
, -
a -
serotonin D012701
depletor -
, -
caused -
no -
significant -
change -
in -
the -
hyperactivity -
. -

The -
study -
suggests -
that -
the -
activity -
- -
increasing -
effects -
of -
morphine D009020
are -
mediated -
by -
the -
release -
of -
catecholamines D002395
from -
adrenergic -
neurons -
in -
the -
brain -
. -

And -
the -
results -
are -
consistent -
with -
the -
hypothesis -
that -
morphine D009020
acts -
by -
retarding -
the -
release -
of -
acetylcholine D000109
at -
some -
central -
cholinergic -
synapses -
. -

It -
is -
also -
suggested -
from -
collected -
evidence -
that -
the -
activity -
- -
increasing -
effects -
of -
morphine D009020
in -
mice -
are -
mediated -
by -
mechanisms -
different -
from -
those -
which -
mediate -
the -
activity -

increasing -
effects -

BACKGROUND -
: -
Although -
different -
methods -
to -
prevent -
bruising -
and -
pain -
following -
the -
subcutaneous -
injection -
of -
heparin D006493
have -
been -
widely -
studied -
and -

is -
little -
documented -
. -

DESIGN -
: -
This -
study -
was -
designed -
as -

research -
. -

METHOD -
: -
The -
sample -
for -
the -
study -
consisted -
of -
50 -
patients -
to -
whom -
subcutaneous -
heparin D006493
was -
administered -
. -

Heparin D006493
was -
injected -
over -
10 -
seconds -
on -
the -
right -
abdominal -
site -
and -
30 -
seconds -
on -
the -
left -
abdominal -
site -
. -

Injections -
areas -
were -
assessed -
for -
the -
presence -
of -
bruising -
at -
48 -
and -
72 -
hours -
after -
each -
injection -
. -

Dimensions -
of -
the -
bruising -
on -
the -
heparin D006493
applied -
areas -
were -
measured -
using -
transparent -
millimetric -
measuring -
paper -
. -

The -
visual -
analog -
scale -
( -
VAS -
) -
was -
used -
to -
measure -
pain -
intensity -
and -
a -
stop -
- -
watch -
was -
used -
to -
time -
the -
pain -
period -
. -

Data -
were -

RESULTS -
: -
The -
percentage -
of -
bruising -
occurrence -
was -
64 -
% -
with -
the -
injection -
of -
10 -
seconds -
duration -
and -
42 -
% -
in -
the -
30 -
- -
second -
injection -
. -

It -
was -
determined -
that -
the -
size -
of -
the -
bruising -
was -
smaller -
in -
the -
30 -
- -
second -
injection -
. -

Pain -
intensity -
and -
pain -
period -
were -
statistically -
significantly -
lower -
for -
the -
30 -
- -
second -
injection -
than -
for -
the -
10 -
- -
second -
injection -
. -

CONCLUSIONS -
: -
It -
was -
determined -
that -
injection -
duration -
had -
an -
effect -
on -
bruising -
and -
pain -
following -
the -
subcutaneous -
administration -
of -
heparin D006493

After -
the -
treatments -
and -
behavioral -
observation -
, -
glutamate D018698
uptake -
by -
segments -
of -
the -
brain -
was -
analyzed -
. -

A -
decreased -
glutamate D018698
uptake -
was -
observed -
in -
the -
subcortical -
parts -
of -
animals -
treated -
with -
reserpine D012110
and -
haloperidol D006220
, -
compared -
to -
the -
control -
. -

Importantly -
, -
a -
decrease -
in -
glutamate D018698
uptake -
correlates -
negatively -
with -
an -
increase -
in -
the -
incidence -
of -
orofacial -
diskinesia -
. -

These -
results -
indicate -
that -
early -
changes -
in -
glutamate D018698
transport -
may -
be -
related -
to -
the -
development -
of -
vacuous -
chewing -
movements -
in -
rats -

The -
development -
of -

is -
usually -
attributed -
to -
the -
interaction -
between -

that -
the -

Visual -

Zonisamide C022189
is -
a -
broad -
- -
spectrum -
antiepileptic -
drug -
used -
to -
treat -
various -
types -
of -
seizures -
. -

Although -
visual -
hallucinations -
have -
not -
been -
reported -
as -
an -
adverse -
effect -
of -
this -
agent -
, -
we -
describe -
three -
patients -
who -
experienced -
complex -
visual -
hallucinations -
and -
altered -
mental -
status -
after -
zonisamide C022189
treatment -
was -
begun -
or -
its -
dosage -
increased -
. -

All -
three -
had -
been -
diagnosed -
earlier -
with -
epilepsy -
, -
and -
their -
electroencephalogram -
( -
EEG -
) -
findings -
were -
abnormal -
. -

During -
monitoring -
, -
visual -
hallucinations -
did -
not -
correlate -
with -

nor -
did -
video -

capture -
any -

the -
described -
events -

None -
of -
the -
patients -
had -
experienced -
visual -
hallucinations -
before -
this -
event -

The -
only -
recent -
change -
in -
their -
treatment -
was -
the -
introduction -

increased -
dosage -
of -
zonisamide C022189

With -
either -
discontinuation -
or -
decreased -
dosage -
of -
the -
drug -
the -
symptoms -
disappeared -

did -
not -
recur -

Further -
observations -

reports -
will -
help -
clarify -
this -
adverse -
effect -

Until -
then -

clinicians -
need -
to -
be -
aware -

In -
this -
study -
, -
three -
Chinese -

with -
ticlopidine D013988

aplastic -
anemia -
were -
reported -
and -
another -
13 -
patients -

We -
attempted -
to -

underlying -
similarities -
, -
evaluate -
the -
risk -
factors -
, -
and -
identify -
appropriate -
treatment -
for -
this -

All -

one -

were -
over -
60 -
years -
old -
, -
and -
the -
6 -
who -
died -
were -
all -
older -
than -

Therefore -
, -
old -
age -
may -
be -
a -
risk -
factor -
for -
developing -
this -
complication -
. -

Agranulocytosis -

so -
frequent -
examination -

There -
seemed -

Treatment -

that -
5 -
of -
the -
6 -
patients -
who -
received -
concurrent -

, -
should -
alert -
clinicians -
to -
be -
more -
cautious -
when -

these -
two -
drugs -
simultaneously -

Facilitation -

Amnesia -
produced -
by -
scopolamine D012601
and -
cycloheximide D003513
were -
reversed -

morphine D009020
given -
30 -
min -
before -
the -
test -
trial -
( -
pre -

, -
and -
pre -

test -
morphine D009020
also -
facilitated -
the -
memory -
retrieval -
in -
the -
animals -
administered -
naloxone D009270
during -
the -
training -
trial -
. -

Similarly -
, -
pre -
- -
test -
scopolamine D012601
partially -
reversed -
the -
scopolamine D012601
- -
induced -
amnesia -

not -
significantly -

cycloheximide D003513
failed -
to -
reverse -
the -
cycloheximide D003513
- -
induced -

These -
results -
suggest -
that -
the -
facilitation -
of -
memory -
retrieval -
by -
pre -
- -
test -
morphine D009020
might -
be -
the -
direct -

Test -
conditions -
influence -
the -
response -
to -

challenge -
in -

These -
studies -
were -
conducted -
to -
examine -
the -
differential -
response -
to -
a -
drug -
challenge -
under -
varied -
experimental -
test -
conditions -
routinely -
employed -
to -
study -

neurophysiological -
responses -
in -
rodents -
. -

Apomorphine D001058
, -
a -
nonselective -
dopamine D018491
agonist -
, -
was -
selected -
due -
to -
its -
biphasic -
behavioral -
effects -
, -
its -
ability -
to -
induce -
hypothermia -
, -
and -
to -
produce -
distinct -
changes -
to -
dopamine D004298
turnover -
in -
the -
rodent -
brain -
. -

From -
such -
experiments -
there -
is -
evidence -
that -
characterization -
and -
detection -
of -
apomorphine D001058
- -
induced -
activity -
in -
rodents -
critically -
depends -
upon -
the -
test -
conditions -
employed -
. -

In -
rats -
, -
detection -
of -
apomorphine D001058
- -
induced -
hyperactivity -
was -
facilitated -
by -
a -
period -
of -
acclimatization -
to -
the -
test -
conditions -
. -

Moreover -
, -
test -
conditions -
can -
impact -
upon -
other -
physiological -
responses -
to -
apomorphine D001058
such -
as -
drug -
- -
induced -
hypothermia -
. -

In -
mice -
, -
apomorphine D001058
produced -
qualitatively -
different -
responses -
under -
novel -
conditions -
when -
compared -
to -
those -
behaviors -
elicited -
in -
the -
home -
test -
cage -
. -

Drug -
- -
induced -
gross -
activity -
counts -
were -
increased -
in -
the -
novel -
exploratory -
box -
only -
, -
while -
measures -
of -
stereotypic -
behavior -
were -
similar -
in -
both -
. -

By -
contrast -

apomorphine D001058

induced -
locomotion -
was -
more -
prominent -
in -
the -
novel -
exploratory -

were -

in -
those -
animals -
exposed -
to -
the -
exploratory -

However -
, -
apomorphine D001058
- -
induced -
reductions -
in -
striatal -
dopamine D004298
turnover -
were -
detected -
in -
both -
novel -
and -

The -
implications -
of -
these -
findings -
are -
