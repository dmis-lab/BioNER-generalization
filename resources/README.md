## Benchmarks
We have published preprocessed datasets used in our experiments.
We plan to publish other automatically generated datasets soon, such as COVID-19, 47, XXY, and African Iron Overload (See Table 8 in our paper).

## Dataset Suggestion
We would like to continuously update datasets that have not been used in our paper but are widely used in the biomedical domain.
Please contact Hyunjae Kim (`hyunjae-kim@korea.ac.kr`) if you have suggestions for additional resources.
We will review the suggested data and make it public after pre-processing.
Note that data must contain **mention** and **CUI annotations** to split the data into Mem, Syn, and Con.
